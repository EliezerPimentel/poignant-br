    - The Goat Wants to Watch a Whole Film: >

        The elevator had opened into a green room full of shelves and file cabinets. 
        Reels of tape and film canisters and video tape everywhere.  Dr. Cham hadn't
        a clue what most of it was.  All he saw was a big, futuristic mess.


        He called out again, stumbling through alleys of narrow shelves, 
        "Hello-o-o??  I'm looking for intellegent life!  I'm
        a space traveller!"  He tripped when his foot slid right into a VCR slot.
        "Any other beings I can communicate with?"


        Hand cupped around mouth, he yelled, "Hello-o-o?"


        "Crying out loud."  The sleepy goat came tromping down the aisle.

        "I hate that book," said the goat.  "I believe the author is disingenuous."


        "Really?" asked Dr. Cham.


        "I'm sure it's all true.  It's just so heavily embellished.  I'm like: 
        Enough already.   I get it.  Cut it out."


        "I'm not quite sure what to make of it," said the Doctor.  "It seems like an honest effort.
        I actually wrote something in Ruby back there."


        "It doesn't give goats a very good name," said the goat.


        "But you are the only goat in the book," said the Doctor.


        "And I'm totally misquoted."

        The goat closed his mouth and Dr. Cham held his heart.


        "I'm actually very literate," said the goat.  "Albeit, more recently, I've switched to
        movies.  I love foreign films.  One of my relatives just brough back _Ishtar_
        from your planet.  Wow, that was excellent."
