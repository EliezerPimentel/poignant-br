        So, now you're wondering why I changed my mind about Ruby.  The quick answer is:
        we clicked.


        Like when you meet Somebody in college and they look like somebody who
        used to hit you in the face with paintbrushes when you were a kid.  And so, impulsively,
        you conclude that this new Somebody is likely a non-friend.  You wince at their
        hair.  You hang up phones loudly during crucial moments in their anecdotes.  You use
        your pogo stick right there where they are trying to walk!


        Six months later, somehow, you and Somebody are sitting at a fountain having a perfectly good
        chat.  Their face doesn't look so much like that childhood nemesis.  You've met
        the Good Twin.  You clicked.


        So whereas I should probably be pounding your teeth in with hype about Ruby and the
        tightly-knit cadre of pertinent ancronyms that accompany it everywhere 
        (whetting the collective whistles of
        your bosses and their bosses' bosses), instead I will just let you coast.  I'll let
        you freefall through some code, interjecting occassionally with my own heartfelt
        experiences.  It'll be quite easy, quite natural.


        I should offer you some sort of motivation, though.  So, Smotchkkiss, I'm going to give my three
        best reasons to learn Ruby and be done with it.


        # *Brain health.* <p>Vitamin R.  Goes straight to the head.  Ruby will
        teach you to _express_ your ideas through a computer.  You will be writing
        stories for a machine.</p> <p>Creative skills, people.  Deduction.  Reason.  Nodding intelligently.
        The language will become a tool for you to better connect your mind to the world.
        I've noticed that many experienced users of Ruby seem to be clear thinkers and
        objective.  (In contrast to: heavily biased and coarse.)</p>
        
        # *One man on one island.* <p>Ruby was born in Japan.  Which is freaky.  Japan is not known
        for its software.  And since programming languages are largely written in English, who
        would suspect a language to come from Japan?</p> <p>And yet, here we have Ruby.  Against the odds,
        Yukihiro Matsumoto created Ruby on February 24, 1993.  For the past ten years, he has steadily
        brought Ruby to a global audience.  It's triumphant and noble and all that.  Support diversity.
        Help us tilt the earth just a bit.</p>

        # *Free.* <p>Using Ruby costs nothing.  The code to Ruby itself is open for all of the world
        to inhale/exhale.  Heck, this book is free.  It's all part of a great, big giveaway that should
        have some big hitch to it.</p> <p>You'd think we'd make you buy vacuums or timeshare or fake Monets.
        You'd think there'd be a 90 minute presentation where the owner of the company comes out at
        the end and knuckles you into sealing the deal.</p> <p>Nope, free.</p>


        With that, it's time for the book to begin.  You can now get out your highlighter and start dragging
        it along each captivating word from this sentence on.  I think I have enough hairspray and
        funny money on my person to keep me sustained until the final page.
