    - And So, The Quick Trip Came To An Eased, Cushioned Halt: >

        So now we have a problem.  I get the feeling that you are enjoying this way too much.
        And you haven't even hit the chapter where I use jump-roping songs to help you learn
        how to parse XML!
 

        If you're already enjoying this, then things are really going bad.  Two chapters from
        now you'll be writing your own Ruby programs.  In fact, it's right about there that I'll
        have you start writing your own role-playing game, your own file-sharing network (a la BitTorrent),
        as well as a program that will pull genuine random numbers from the Internet.  


        !>i/graph-1.gif(Proof has been extracted from the pudding.)!


        And you know (you've got to know!) that this is going to turn into an obsession.  First, you'll
        completely forget to take the dog out.  It'll be standing by the screen door, darting its head
        about, as your eyes devour the code, as your fingers slip messages to the computer.


        Thanks to your neglect, things will start to break.  Your mounds of printed 
        sheets of code will cover up your air vents.  Your furnace
        will choke.  The trash will pile-up: take-out boxes you hurriedly ordered in, junk mail you couldn't
        care to dispose of.  Your own uncleanliness will pollute the air.  Moss will infest the rafters, the water
        will clog, animals will let themselves in, trees will come up through the foundations.


        But your computer will be well-cared for.  And you, Smotchkkiss, will have nourished it with your knowledge.
        In the eons you will have spent with your machine, you will have become part-CPU.  And it will
        have become part-flesh.  Your arms will flow directly into its ports.  Your eyes will accept
        the video directly from DVI-24 pin.  Your lungs will sit just above the processor, cooling it.


        And just as the room is ready to force itself shut upon you, just as all the overgrowth swallows you
        and your machine, you will finish your script.  You and the machine together will run this latest Ruby
        script, the product of your obsession.  And the script will fire up chainsaws to trim the trees, hearths
        to warm and regulate the house.  Builder nanites will rush from your script, reconstructing your quarters,
        retiling, renovating, chroming, polishing, disinfecting.  Mighty androids will force your crumbling house into
        firm, rigid architecture.  Great pillars will rise, statues chiseled.  You will have dominion over this
        palatial estate and over the encompassing mountains and islands of your stronghold.


        So I guess you're going to be okay.  Whatdya say?  Let's get moving on this script of yours?
