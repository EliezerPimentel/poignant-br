      About Ruby Versions: >

        If you've visited any sites which offer Ruby for download, you've probably seen a number
        of different versions of Ruby available.  Obviously, the greater the version number, the
        more recent the version of Ruby.  But that's not exactly true.  Version numbers have meaning
        in Rubyland and I'd like you to make an educated choice.


        *1.8.3* is the latest *stable* version of Ruby.  Stable versions offer the latest features
        which have been widely tested and are recommended for general use.  When new stable versions
        come out, you can safely upgrade to these new versions.


        *1.9.0* is the latest *development* release of Ruby.  The development release includes
        experimental changes to Ruby and unfixed problems.  This release is for anyone who wants
        take a peep into the future of Ruby at the risk of encountering some bugs.


        Now, you'll notice that the version number is comprised of three individual numbers,
        which are: *the major version*, *the minor version*, and *the teeny version*.  The 
        major version counts each complete rewrite of Ruby.  The minor version is changed based
        on sweeping changes to Ruby.  The teeny version is incremented every few months as smaller
        changes and bug fixes are brought in.


        All editions of Ruby thus far have a major version of 1.  When Ruby2 comes along, you'll
        see this notch up one.


        The minor version indicates whether a version is stable or not.  *If the minor version
        is an even number, then that version of Ruby is stable.   If it's odd, then that Ruby
        is a development version.*  After a year or so, when the development version is ready 
        for the world, both numbers are increased and the teeny version is returned to zero.


        Oh, and if I could give you a taste of how smoothly Ruby moves along!  I can't count
        how often a fresh idea lands on the Ruby-Core mailing list, where the Emperors of
        Ruby converse, and *that same idea* gets worked into Ruby within a few days.  It is
        a lovely machine says I.
