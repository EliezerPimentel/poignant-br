      A respeito do uso comercial do (Poignant) Guide: >

        Este livro foi lançado sob a licença Creative Commons que permite uso comercial ilimitado
        deste texto.  Basicamente, isto significa que você pode vender todas cópias piratas do meu livro
        e ficar com todo o lucro pra você.  Eu confio nos meus leitores (e no mundo ao redor deles) para me passar pra trás.
        E colocar uma edição em Xerox com aquele clipart das mãos unidas rezando, que nós conhecemos, na capa.


        Guys, the lawsuits just ain't worth the headache.  So I'm just going to straight up endorse
        authorized piracy, folks.  Anybody who wants to read the book should be able to read it.
        Anybody who wants to market the book or come up with special editions, I'm flattered.


        Why would I want the $$$?  IGNORE ALL OTHER SIDEBARS: I've lost the will to be a rich slob.  
        Sounds inhuman, but I like my little black-and-white television.  Also my hanging plastic flower lamp.
        I don't want to be a career writer.  Cash isn't going inspire me.  Pointless.


        So, if money means nothing to the lucky stiff, why rip me off when you could co-opt shady
        business practices to literally crush my psyche and leave me wheezing in some sooty iron lung?  
        Oh, and the irony of using my own works against me!  Die, Poignant Boy!


        To give you an idea of what I mean, here are a few underhanded concepts that could seriously
        kill my willpower and force me to reconsider things like existence.


        *IDEA ONE: BIG TOBACCO*


        Compre uma companhia de cigarros.  Use my cartoon foxes to fuel an aggressive ad campaign.  
        Here's a billboard for starters:


        !i/the.foxes-0a.png(Addiction is like Pokemon!)!


        Deixe óbvio que seu público alvo são crianças e asmáticos.  Then, once you've got
        everyone going, have the *truth* people do an expose on me and my farm of inky foxes.


        bq. *Sensible Hipster Standing on Curb in Urban Wilderness*: He calls himself the lucky stiff.
        
        
        bq. (Pulls aside curtain to reveal grey corpse on a gurney.)


        bq. *Hipster*: Some stiffs ain't so lucky.


        bq. (Erratic zoom in.  Superimposed cartoon foxes for subliminal Willy Wonka mind trip.)


        Yo.  Why you gotta dis Big Smokies like dat, Holmes?


        *IDEA TWO: HEY, FIRING SQUAD*


        Like I said, start selling copies of my book, but corrupt the text.  These altered copies
        would contain numerous blatant (and libelous) references to government agencies, such as the
        U.S. Marshals and the Pentagon.  You could make me look like a complete traitor.  Like I have
        all these plans to, you know, kill certain less desirable members of the U.S. Marshals or
        the Pentagon.


        Not that there are any less desirable members of the U.S. Marshals or the Pentagon.  Yeah,
        I didn't mean it like that.


        Oh, crap.


        Oh, crap.  Oh, crap.  Oh, crap.


        Turn off the lights.  Get down.


        *IDEA THREE: BILLBOARDS, PART II*


        How about making fun of asthmatics directly?


        !i/the.foxes-0b.png(Call it a puffer! ROFL!)!


        *IDEA FOUR: ALEC BALDWIN*


        Adapt the book into a movie.  And since, you know, I'm a character in this book, 
        you could get someone like Alec Baldwin to play me.  Someone who's at a real lowpoint
        in his career.


        You could make it seem like I did tons of drugs.  Like I was insane to work with.
        Like I kept firing people and locking them in the scooter room and making them
        wear outfits made of bread.  Yeah, like I could actually be _baking_ people into
        the outfits.


        You could have this huge mold that I strap people into.  Then, I pour all the dough
        on them and actually bake them until the bread has risen and they've almost died.
        And when the television crews come and I'm on Good Morning America, they'll ask,
        "So, how many people have you employed in the production of your book?"  And I'd
        respond, "A baker's dozen!" and erupt into that loud maniacal laughing that would
        force audience members to cup their hands over their ears.


        Of course, in the throes of my insanity, I would declare war on the world.  The
        bread people would put up quite a fight.  Until the U.S. Marshals (or the Pentagon)
        engineer a giant robotic monkey brain (played by Burt Lancaster) to come after me.


        Here's where you'll make me look completely lame.  Not only will I sacrifice all of
        the bread people (the Starchtroopers) to save myself, not only will I surrender to
        the great monkey brain like a coward, but when I narrowly escape, I'll yell at the
        audience.  Screaming insistently that it's _MY_ movie and no one should see it any
        more, I'll rip the screen in half and the film projector will spin with its reel
        flapping in defeat.  And that will be the end of the movie.  People will be _so_
        pissed.


        Now, I've got to thinking.  See, and actually, Alec Baldwin did a decent voiceover
        in _The Royal Tenenbaums_.  His career might be okay.  You might not want to use him.
        He might not do it.


        Tell ya what.  I'll play the part.  I've made a career out of lowpoints.
