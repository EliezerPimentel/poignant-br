      !i/wixl-2.gif(This heist goes all the way up?)!


      Oblivious to their involvement in the expansive plan of The Originals, both the tall fox and the
      much shorter fox had wandered right into the red alert zone, the city Wixl.  I desire a spatula
      to scoop them aside with, shuffle them off to the coast near the beach hatcheries, hide them in
      piles of fish eggs, hold down their pointy ears, concealing their luxurious hides.  And above them
      I would stand, casting an unmoving shadow, holding my rifle aloof.


      I can't.  I have you to teach.  I have to groom and care for myself.  The lightbulbs
      upstairs need changing.  A free pack of halogen lightbulbs just showed up out of the mail.  Somebody out
      there is obviously trying to get me to use them.  So I'm going to screw 'em in.  And just stand there,
      casting an unmoving shadow, holding my rifle aloof.


      Should that shadow be nice and defined, then I'll keep 'em.
