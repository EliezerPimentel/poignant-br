        I like seeing these two out in the wild.  They got pretty bored here in the studio.  They started making
        up wierd slogans and stuff.  They had some phrase they kept repeating, forming fixations upon.
        You can't be exposed to all that contrived fox nonsense.
        

        Let's just say: I am really trying my best to keep things collegiate.  Having never attended college, I can't
        well say if every passage written chimes right with the stringent criteria which academia demands.
        I have university friends aplenty, some who tour the globe in their pursuits, and I try to
        inflect my voice with just their blend of high culture.


        Sometimes I applaud myself for going beyond the work of my educated friends -- only in quiet corridors, we never
        butt heads publicly -- because _I have actually subscribed_ to a school of thought while they are still
        in their books, turning and turning.


        *I am a preeventualist.*  I have dabbled in it long enough and am glad to come forth with it.
        Inevitably, some of you have already started mining this book for Marxist symbology.  I am sad
        to kill those interpretations, but I believe any nihilist conclusions you've drawn will still hold up
        under scrutiny.


        Anyway, I'll drop the rhetoric.  I only mention preeventualism because, aside from being a refreshing
        and easy alternative to the post-modernism we're born with, _this_ meta-cult offers a free lost-and-found
        service for the residents of Wixl.

        I have no way of alerting the foxes to this service.  And I'm sure it's too soon for their truck to be listed.
        Still, the good intentions are here.


        If you're connected to the Internet, the above Ruby should have downloaded the web page from the Internet and
        printed it to the screen.  In a message resembling this:
