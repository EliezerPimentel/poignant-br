        And now, Paij-ree's stories of the Lotteries.


        On Endertromb, the organist's father invented the lottery.  The idea came while
        he was praying to Digger Dosh.


        Digger Dosh is sort of like their God.  But ten times scarier.  This
        guy dug an infinitely deep tunnel straight through the planet and came out dead.
        But he's really not dead.  He's really just _one second_ behind them.  And he eats time.


        It's kind of complicated because Digger Dosh totally kills people.  But I guess if 
        you do what he says, it's not so bad.  Maybe I'll talk about it later.  It's such a
        pain to talk about because it's so scary and yet one of my friends actually believes
        the whole thing.  I get kind of choked up -- not like I'm crying, more like I'm choking.


        Anyway, once while praying, three numbers came to Paij-ree's father.


        He then asked his mind, "What are these numbers?"


        And his mind played a short video clip of him selling all kinds of numbers.  And, for
        years and years, travelling and selling numbers.


        And he asked his brain, "People will buy numbers?"


        And his brain said, "If they buy the right three numbers, give them a prize."


        At which he imagined himself launching off a ski jump and showering people with
        presents.  No question: he would be an icon.


        So he went and did as his brain said and sold numbers.  The father's simple lottery
        consisted of three unique numbers, drawn from a set of 25 numbers.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket

           NUMERIC_RANGE = 1..25

           attr_reader :picks, :purchased

           def initialize( *picks )
             if picks.length != 3
               raise ArgumentError, "three numbers must be picked"
             elsif picks.uniq.length != 3
               raise ArgumentError, "the three picks must be different numbers"
             elsif picks.detect { |p| not NUMERIC_RANGE === p }
               raise ArgumentError, "the three picks must be numbers between 1 and 25."
             end
             @picks = picks
             @purchased = Time.now
           end

         end
        </pre>


        Yes, the @LotteryTicket@ class contained the three numbers (@@picks@) and the
        time when the ticket was bought (@@purchased@).  The allowed range of numbers
        (from *one* to *twenty-five*) is kept in the constant @NUMERIC_RANGE@.


        The @initialize@ method here can have any number of arguments passed in.  The
        *asterisk* in the @picks@ argument means that *any arguments will be passed
        in as an Array*.  Having the arguments in an Array means that methods like
        @uniq@ and @detect@ can be used on the arguments together.


        This class contains two definitions: the method definition (@def@) and
        an attributes definition (@attr_reader@).  Both are *really just method definitions*
        though.


        The @attr_reader@ shortcut is identical to writing this Ruby code:


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def picks; @picks; end
           def purchased; @purchased; end
         end
        </pre>


        Attributes are wrapper methods for instance variables (such as @@picks@) which can be used
        *outside of the class itself*.  Paij-ree's father wanted to code a machine which
        could read the numbers and the date of purchase from the ticket.  In order to do that,
        those instance variables must be exposed.


        Let's create a random ticket and read back the numbers:


        <pre>
         ticket = LotteryTicket.new( rand( 25 ) + 1,
                     rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1 )
         p ticket.picks
        </pre>


        Running the above, I just got: @[23, 14, 20]@.  You will get an error if two of
        the random numbers happen to be identical.


        However, I can't change the lottery ticket's picks from outside of the class.


        <pre>
         ticket.picks = [2, 6, 19]
        </pre>


        I get an error: @undefined method `picks='@.
        This is because @attr_reader@ only adds a *reader* method, not a writer method.
        That's fine, though.  We don't want the numbers or the date to change.


        So, the tickets are _objects_.  Instances of the @LotteryTicket@ class.  Make a
        ticket with @LotteryTicket.new@.  Each ticket has it's own @@picks@ and it's own
        @@purchased@ instance variables.


        The lottery captain would need to draw three random numbers at the close
        of the lottery, so we'll add a convenient class method for generating random
        tickets.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def self.new_random
             new( rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1 )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Oh, no.  But we have that stupid error that pops up if two of the random numbers
        happen to be identical.  If two numbers are the same, the @initialize@ throws
        an @ArgumentError@.


        The trick is going to be restarting the method if an error happens.
        We can use Ruby's @rescue@ to handle the error and @redo@ to start the method
        over.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def self.new_random
             new( rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1 )
           rescue ArgumentError
             redo
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Better.  It may take a couple times for the numbers to fall together right,
        but it'll happen.  The wait will build suspense, huh?


        The lottery captain kept a roster of everyone who bought tickets, along
        with the numbers they drew.


        <pre>
         class LotteryDraw
           @@tickets = {}
           def LotteryDraw.buy( customer, *tickets )
             unless @@tickets.has_key?( customer )
               @@tickets[customer] = []
             end
             @@tickets[customer] += tickets
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Yal-dal-rip-sip was the first customer.


        <pre>
         LotteryDraw.buy 'Yal-dal-rip-sip',
             LotteryTicket.new( 12, 6, 19 ),
             LotteryTicket.new( 5, 1, 3 ),
             LotteryTicket.new( 24, 6, 8 )
        </pre>


        When it came time for the lottery draw, Paij-ree's father (the lottery captain) added
        a bit of code to randomly select the numbers.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def score( final )
             count = 0
             final.picks.each do |note|
               count +=1 if picks.include? note
             end
             count
           end
         end
        </pre>


        The @score@ method compares a @LotteryTicket@ against a random ticket,
        which represents the winning combination.  The random ticket is passed in
        through the @final@ variable.  The ticket gets one point for every winning
        number.  The point total is returned from the @score@ method.


        <pre>
         irb> ticket = LotteryTicket.new( 2, 5, 19 )
         irb> winner = LotteryTicket.new( 4, 5, 19 )
         irb> ticket.score( winner )
           => 2
        </pre>


        You will see how brilliant Paij-ree is, in time.  His father commissioned him
        to finish the lottery for him, while the demand for tickets consumed the
        lottery captain's daylight hours.  Can't you just imagine young Paij-ree in his stuffy
        suit, snapping a rubber band in his young thumbs at the company meetings where he proposed the
        final piece of the system?  Sure, when he stood up, his dad did all the talking for
        him, but he flipped on the projector and performed all the hand motions.

 
        <pre>
         class << LotteryDraw
           def play
             final = LotteryTicket.new_random
             winners = {}
             @@tickets.each do |buyer, ticket_list|
               ticket_list.each do |ticket|
                 score = ticket.score( final )
                 next if score.zero?
                 winners[buyer] ||= []
                 winners[buyer] << [ ticket, score ]
               end
             end
             @@tickets.clear
             winners
           end
         end
        </pre>


        His father's associates were stunned.  What was this?  (Paij-ree knew this
        was just another class method definition -- they would all feel completely
        demoralized when he told them so.)  They couldn't understand the *double
        angle bracket* up there!  Yes, it was a concatenator, but how is it in
        the class title?


        _Infants_, thought Paij-ree, although he held everyone of those men in very
        high esteem.  He was just a kid and kids are tough as a brick's teeth. 


        The @<<@ operator allows you to alter the definition of an object.
        Had Paij-ree simply used @class LotteryDraw@, his @play@ method would be
        a normal instance method.  But since he used the @<<@ operator, the @play@
        method will be added directly to the class, as a class method.  


        When you see @class << obj@, believe in your heart, _I'm adding directly to the definition
        of @obj@._


        The budding organ instructor also threw in a tricky syntax worth examining.
        In the ninth line, a winner has been found.


        <pre>
         winners[buyer] ||= []
         winners[buyer] << [ ticket, score ]
        </pre>


        The @||=@ syntax is a shortcut.


        <pre>
         winners[buyer] = winners[buyer] || []
        </pre>


        The *double pipe* is an *or* logic.  Set @winners[buyer]@ equal to @winners[buyer]@ or,
        if @winners[buyer]@ is nil, set it to @[]@.  This shortcut is a little strange, but if you
        can really plant it in your head, it's a nice timesaver.  You're just making sure a variable
        is set before using it.


        <pre>
         irb> LotteryDraw.play.each do |winner, tickets|
         irb>   puts winner + "won on " + tickets.length + " ticket(s)!"
         irb>   tickets.each do |ticket, score|
         irb>     puts "\t" + ticket.picks.join( ', ' ) + ": " + score
         irb>   end
         irb> end

         Gram-yol won on 2 ticket(s)!
             25, 14, 33: 1
             12, 11, 29: 1
         Tarker-azain won on 1 ticket(s)!
             13, 15, 29: 2
         Bramlor-exxon won on 1 ticket(s)!
             2, 6, 14: 1
        </pre>


        But these salad days were not to continue for Paij-ree and his father.  His father often
        neglected to launder his uniform and contracted a moss disease on his shoulders.  The disease
        gradually stole his equilibrium and his sense of direction.


        His father still futilely attempted to keep the business running.  He spiraled through the
        city, sometimes tumbling leg-over-leg down the cobbled stone, most often slowly feeling the walls,
        counting bricks to the math parlours and coachmen stations, where he would thrust tickets
        at the bystanders, who hounded him and slapped him away with long, wet beets.  Later, Paij-ree
        would find him in a corner, his blood running into the city drains alongside the juices of the
        dark, splattered beets, which juice weaseled its way up into his veins and stung and clotted
        and glowed fiercely like a congested army of brake lights fighting their way through toll bridges.


        h3. A Word About Accessors (Because I Love You and I Hope For Your Success and My Hair is On End
        About This and Dreams Really Do Come True)
        

        Earlier, I mentioned that @attr_reader@ adds *reader* methods, but not *writer* methods.


        <pre>
         irb> ticket = LotteryTicket.new
         irb> ticket.picks = 3
         NoMethodError: undefined method `picks=' for #<LotteryTicket:0xb7d49110>
        </pre>


        Which is okay in this case, since Paij-ree's father didn't want the numbers to be
        changed after the ticket was bought.  If we were interested in having instance
        variables which had *both readers and writers*, we would use @attr_accessor@.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           attr_accessor :picks, :purchased
         end
        </pre>


        Which is exactly the same as this lengthier code:


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def picks;           @picks;            end
           def picks=(var);     @picks = var;      end
           def purchased;       @purchased;        end
           def purchased=(var); @purchased = var;  end
         end
        </pre>


        Holy cats!  Look at those writer methods for a moment.  They are the methods named
        @picks=@ and @purchased=@.  These methods *intercept outside assignment* to instance variables.
        Usually you will just let @attr_reader@ or @attr_accessor@ (or even perhaps @attr_writer@)
        do the work for you.
        Other times you may want to put a guard at the door yourself, checking variables in closer
        detail.


        <pre>
         class SkatingContest
           def the_winner; @the_winner; end
           def the_winner=( name )
             unless name.respond_to? :to_str
               raise ArgumentError, "The winner's name must be a String,
                 not a math problem or a list of names or any of that business."
             end
             @the_winner = name
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Most of the time you won't use this.  But, as we move along through your lessons, you'll find that
        Ruby has lots of escape hatches and alley ways you can sneak into and hack code into.  I'm also
        preparing you for metaprogramming, which, if you can smell that dragon, is ominously near.
