          we're all sifting through the carpet here at hq, but if you could all keep an eye out 
          for caitlin's clipboard, she's too quiet of a gal to post it and i know that it's 
          REALLY important to her.  she had a few really expensive panoramic radiographs of her 
          husband's underbite clipped to a few irreplacable photos of her husband in a robocop 
          costume back when the underbite was more prominent.  she says (to me), "they'll know
          what i mean when they see them."  i don't know what that means.  :(

          i've checked: * the front desk * the hall * the waiting area * the bathroom * the candy 
          closet * the big tv area * the lunch counter * the disciples room * gaff's old room
          (the one with the painting of the cherry tree) * the server room * staircase.  i'll 
          update this as i find more rooms.
