      The Shoes Which Lies Are Made Of: >

        _Earlier, I told you that "The Inadvertant Meteor" was the only story you need to know in order to
        understand preeventualism.  But, really, all you need to understand about preeventualism is that
        it is still in its infancy and any of its most basic concepts could change._


        _Which is why I've authored a competing story which I believe uncovers an entirely different
        and very relevant intellectual scenario._


        There was a guy who had been around the block.  And he wasn't very old, so he decided to write
        a biography of his life.


        Well, he started to lie in his biography.  He made up some stories.  But mostly little stories
        that were inconsequential.  Filler.  Like he had a story about a painting he'd done of a red
        background with elephant legs in front.


        But he hadn't ever painted anything of the sort.  He further embellished the story by talking
        about a pricey auction he'd snuck into.  An auction in New York City where he'd he overheard his
        painting go to sale for twenty grand.  But that wasn't the point of the story.  The point was
        that he could fold his body to fit under a lid on a banquet tray.  People would raise the lid and
        they wouldn't even notice him bracing himself inside.  He didn't even mention the price his painting
        sold at.


        Anyway, he really started to like that story (and others like it), to the point where he
        started to ignore his friends and family, instead preferring to watch what his lie self did after the
        auction.  In his head.


        So, then, one day he was shopping and he found a pair of shoes that had stripey laces.
        And he grabbed the shoes and went to the store counter, forcing them in the cashier's
        face, yelling, "Look! Look at these! Look! These are the shoes my lie self would
        wear!"  And he bought the shoes and put them on and the whole Earth cracked open and
        the cash register popped open and swallowed him up and he was suddenly elsewhere, in his
        lie apartment, sitting down to paint dolphin noses, three of them on a green background.


        It was a lot of work, painting all those noses.  And he went broke for a while and had
        to stoop so low as to filming abominable snowman NASCAR.
