      What I'm Going to Do With the Massive Proceeds from this Book: >

        Anyone who's written a book can tell you how easily an author is distracted by visions of grandeur.
        In my experience, I stop twice for each paragraph, and four times for each panel of a comic, just to
        envision the wealth and prosperity that this book will procure for my lifestyle.  I fear that the writing
        of this book will halt altogether to make way for the armada of SUVs and luxury towne cars that are
        blazing away in my head.


        Rather than stop my production of the (Poignant) Guide, I've reserved this space as a safety zone
        for pouring my empty and vain wishes.


        Today I was at this Italian restaraunt, Granado's, and I was paying my bill.  Happened to notice (under
        glass) a bottle of balsamic vinegar going for $150.  Fairly small.  I could conceal it in my
        palm.  Aged twenty-two years.


        I've spent a lot of time thinking about that bottle.  It is often an accessory in some of these
        obsessive fantasies.  In one fantasy, I walk into the restaraunt, toss a stack of greenery on the counter
        and earnestly say to the cashier, "Quick! I have an important salad to make!"


        In another, related fantasy, I am throwing away lettuce.  Such roughage isn't befitting of my new
        vinegar.  No, I will have come to a point where the fame and the aristocracy will have corrupted me
        to my core.  My new lettuce will be cash.  Cold, hard cash, Mrs. Price.


        Soon, I will be expending hundreds for a block of myzithra cheese.


        My imaginations have now gone beyond posessions, though.  Certainly, I have thought through my
        acquisition of grecian urns, motorcades, airlines, pyramids, dinosaur bones.  Occassionally I'll
        see wind-tossed cities on the news and I'll jot down on my shopping list: _Hurricane_.
        

        But, now I'm seeing a larger goal.  Simply put: what if I amassed such a fortune that the mints
        couldn't print enough to keep up with my demand?  So, everyone else would be forced to use Monopoly money as
        actual currency.  And you would have to win in Monopoly to keep food on the table.  These would be
        some seriously tense games.  I mean you go to mortgage St. James Place and your kids start crying.
        In addition, I think you'll begin to see the end of those who choose to use the Free Parking square
        as "the underground coffers":http://groups.yahoo.com/group/monopoly/message/37 for city funds.


        You've got to hand it to fun money, though.  Fake money rules.  You can get your hands on it
        so quickly.  For a moment, it seems like you're crazy rich.  When I was a kid, I got with some
        of the neighborhood kids and we built this little Tijuana on our street.  We made our own pesos and
        wore sombreros and everything!


        One kid was selling hot tamales for two pesos each.  _Two pesos!_  Did this kid know that the money was fake?
        Was he out of his mind?  Who invited this kid?  Didn't he know this wasn't really Tijuana?  Maybe he was really from Tijuana!
        Maybe these were _real_ pesos!  Let's go make more _real_ pesos!


        I think we even had a tavern where you could get totally hammered off Kool-Aid.  There's nothing like
        a bunch of kids stumbling around, mumbling incoherently with punchy red clown lips.
