      Another Excerpt from The Scarf Eaters: >

        (_from Chapter VIII: Sky High_.)


        "I know you," said Brent.  "And I know your timelines.
        You couldn't have done this Flash piece."


        "So, you're saying I'm predictable?" said Deborah.  She
        opened her hands and the diced potatoes stumbled like little,
        drunk sea otters happily into the open crockpot.


        "You're very linear," said Brent.  He took up a mechanical pencil,
        held it straight before his eyes, gazing tightly at it before
        replacing it in the pencil holder on the counter.  "Do you
        even know how to load a scene?  How to jump frames?  This
        movie I saw was all over the place, Deb."


        She heaped five knit scarves and a single bandana into the slow
        cooker and set it on high.  She closed the lid, leaving her hand
        resting upon it.


        "What is it about this movie?"  Deborah asked.  "You go to
        Flash sites all the time.  You played the Elf Snowball game
        for two seconds, it didn't interest you.  You didn't care for
        Elf Bowling games even.  And you weren't even phased by that
        Hit The Penguin flash game.  Elf versus Penguin?  Don't even
        ask!


        "Now this movie comes along and you can't get a grip."
        She walked over and siddled up next to him.  "Yo, bro, it's me.
        Deborah.  What happened when you saw that movie?"


        "Everything," said Brent, his eyes reflecting a million worlds.
        "And: nothing.  It opened with a young girl riding upon a wild
        boar.  She was playing harmonica.  The harmonica music washed in
        and out, uneasy, unsure.  But she rode naturally, as if it wasn't
        anything of a big deal to ride a wild boar.  And with
        Flash, riding a wild boar really isn't a big deal."


        Deborah unclasped her bracelet and set it on the counter by the
        crockpot.


        "The bottom of the movie started to break up, an ink puddle formed.
        The boar reared up, but his legs gave way to the all the dark,
        sputtering ink."


        "Dark clouds converged.  Hardcore music started to play.  Secret
        agents came out of the clouds.  CIA guys and stuff.  The animation
        simply rocked.


        "And then, at the very end of the movie, these words fade upon the
        screen.  In white, bold letters."


        "Sky high," said Deborah.


        "How did you know?" Brent's lip quivered.  Could she be trusted?


        "There is no room left in the world," she said.  "No room for Scarf Eaters,
        no room for you and I.  Here, take my hand."
