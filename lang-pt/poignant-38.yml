      Frankly, I'm sick and tired of hearing that Dr. Cham was a madman.  Yes, he tried to bury
      himself alive.  Yes, he electrocuted his niece.  Yes, in fact, he did dynamite a retirement
      home.  But this was all with good cause and, in each case, I believe he took the
      correct course of action.


      I'm sure you'd like to side with popular opinion, but you're bound
      to feel some small trickle of admiration for him once he's taken time to teach you all 
      about Ruby's class definitions.
      And moreso when you learn about mixins.  And perhaps, by the end of the chapter, we can all
      start to look beyond the Doctor's grievous past and stop calling him a madman.


      So if you need to call him a madman, I'd start heading down to the train tracks to
      smash up some long flourescent light bulbs.  Get it out of your system right now, 
      before we dig in.
