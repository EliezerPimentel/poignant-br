      The Scarf Eaters: >
      
        I hate to intrude upon your instruction, but I've already walked all over it enough to 
        warrant some further disregard.  Can I go over my next project with you?


        I've pledged to write another book.  (_Trombones_.)  The good news is that I won't actually
        be writing any of it.  You won't have to endure any more of this inane blathering.


        It's over between me and words.  I'd love to stick around and exploit them each, one after
        another, but it's all becoming quite predictable, wouldn't you say?  Eventually, they will
        all be used and I'd have to come up with fake words and that would be way too cnoofy.


        Now.  The deal isn't cut yet, but I'm in negotiations with Anna Quindlen to do my ghost writing.
        We're tag-teaming on a book that's going to blow the (Poignant) Guide right out of your hands. 
        To put it bluntly, the Guide will be worthless.  You won't be able to pile enough 
        pomegranates on top of the thing.


        So this new book.  The Scarf Eaters.  It's a coming-of-age novel.  But it's also a beginner's
        guide to Macromedia Flash.  It's like Judy Blume crossed Praystation.  It's like 0sil8 starring
        Hillary Duff.


        I don't want to give away the plot at all, but to tug your appetite I'll just say this:
        one kid talks to his dead brother in ActionScript.  More to come.
