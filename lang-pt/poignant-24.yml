      I've never seen the ham do anything but leak juice.  Today, our
      business in Ambrose Caverns is with the elf.  He is a crucial part of the next lessons.
      Let's all make him feel welcome. Go start warming up your listening hats!  
      (And please change out of those ridiculous stirrup pants.)


      A prompt warning: this lesson is much slower.  Stay with it.  This will be a long, deep breath.
      The most crucial stage of your instruction.  It may seem like you're not learning much code at
      first.  You will be learning concepts.  By the end of this chapter, you will know Ruby's
      beauty.  The coziness of the code will become a down sleeping bag for your own solace.
