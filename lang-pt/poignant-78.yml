        Um dia, há algum tempo atrás quando conheci o Bigelow (o cachorro que fugiu com os balões), Eu voltei pro meu apartamento
        hauling some board games I'd bought at a garage sale.  And Quil was on my porch.  O que me surpreendeu pois ela estava em
        San Antonio por três meses.  She was sleeping in a sleeping bag on my porch.


        Ela não tinha grana para a escola de artes, então ela ficou na minha casa por uns cinco meses.


        I found this used bunkbed for our place.  At night we'd sit in our beds and read each other stories 
        from our notebooks.  Eu estava escrevendo um livro sobre
        uma criança que era um detetive e estava tentando descobrir quem matou this kid on his tennis team and all these animals
        end up helping him figure it out.  She was writing a book about this kid who puts an ad in the classifieds to get
        other kids to join his made-up cult and they end up building a rocket ship.  But during most of her book these
        kids are lost in the woods and pretty directionless, which I got a kick out of hearing each night.


        Yeah, each night it was poetry or stories or ideas for tricking our neighbors.  Our neighbor Justin was
        a big fan of Warhammer and he had all these real swords and tunics.  We decided to make suits of armor out of tin
        foil and go attack his apartment.  We started ransacking his apartment and he loved it.  So he made his own suit
        of armor out of tin foil and we all went to a professional glamour studio and had a quality group shot taken.

        Não estou dizendo que minha vida é melhor que a sua. Eu simplesmente sinto falta da minha irmã. As coisas não são mais como antigamente.
        Estamos dissolvidos ou algo do tipo.


        Não sei.  Tô confuso.  Is this growing up?  Watching all your feathers come off?  And even though some of those
        feathers were the most lovely things?


        I'm having a hard time telling who stopped it all up.  Who stopped loving who?  Did I stop caring?  Maybe I only
        saw her in two-dimensions and I didn't care to look at the other angles.  I only saw planes.  Then she shimmied up the z-axis when I wasn't
        looking and I never did the homework to trace the coordinates.  A limb on a geometrical tree and I am insisting on circles.


        Blix estava certo.  I'm in so shape to write this book.  Goodbye until I can shake this.
