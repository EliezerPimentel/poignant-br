    - Them What Make the Rules: >

        Hannah lept back from the wall and clenched down on her fingers.


        "This is the wall," said Dr. Cham.  "The Originals are in there.  My child, can you
        lead us to the observation deck?"


        "You expect us to go up against those guys?" asked the goat.  "They're mad as koalas.  But these
        koalas have lasers!"


        "We prevail, though," said Dr. Cham.  "You and I know this."


        "Okay, well I'm muddled on that point," said the goat.  "Do we really win?
        Or could we be thinking about _Kramer vs. Kramer_?  Does Dustin Hoffman win or do we win?"


        "No.  No.  No.  No."  Hannah hovered and dragged her legs along the wall nervously.
        "There is a man with a huge face in there!"


        "Mr. Face," said the Doctor.  "He is the original face."


        "He didn't see me," said Hannah and moaned.  *HOMA-HOMA-ALLO-ALLO.*


        She made that hollow weeping through the crumbling mouseholes and the freezer gateways,
        fluxing in and out, causing the video checkpoints to hiss and the wall panels to
        brace themselves and fall silent.  The three passed through two levels of frayed security
        and emerged in the observation deck overlooking the cargo bay.

        "The last living among The Originals," said Dr. Cham.  "Are you alright with this,
        Hannah?"  Which she didn't hear in any way, as her eyes laid fixed on the legendary
        creatures.


        "Look at them," said the goat.  "These guys wrote the rule books, Doctor.  We owe
        everything to these guys."


        "What about God?" said Dr. Cham.

        
        "I don't really know," said the goat.  "Hannah probably knows better than any of us
        about that."


        Hannah said nothing.  She only really knew one other ghost and that was her Post-Decease Mediator,
        Jamie Huft.  Who didn't seem to have any answers for her and required questions to be submitted
        in writing with a self-addressed stamped envelope included.  Hannah hadn't gotten the ball rolling
        on that P.O. Box yet.


        "We must be up in the mountains," said the goat.  "Look out at that blackness."


        "I saw another deck like this down by where we found Hannah," said Dr. Cham.  "Down closer
        to your living area.  You should take time to search for it.  It's very peaceful there.
        You can see Earth and the seven seas."


        "The seven seas?"  The goat wondered if that was near The Rockettes.  He'd read his share
        of material on precision dancing and he'd seen that line of legs, mincing across the
        stage like a big, glitsy rototiller.
        

        Hannah stirred to life.


        !i/the.originals-2.jpg(Hannah panicks. Maple donuts are within reach.)!


        !i/the.originals-3.jpg(They couldn't hear them, but they saw their slides.)!


        And none of the three spoke when The Originals flicked off the slide projector
        and boarded a very slender rocketship and cleanly exploded through a crevice in the
        cargo bay roof.


        "Oh, boy," said the goat.


        "What?" said Hannah.


        "You're going to die," said the goat.


        Dr. Cham looked over the controls in front of them, a long panel of padded handles and
        green screens.


        "I'm already dead.  I'm a ghost."


        The goat looked down at the Doctor, who was rummaging under the control panel.  "Okay, well
        if your uncle isn't going to have a talk with you, I'm going to make things very clear.  There's
        a good chance these guys are going to build a bomb.  And you see how I'm fidgeting?  You see
        how my knees are wobbling?"


        "Yeah."


        "Yeah, that's how real this is, kid.  I don't remember anything from that _confounded book_ except
        that these guys are building a bomb that can blow up the ghost world.  
        Because once the ghost world's gone, then Digger Dosh gets his one second back.  
        It's a trade they've worked out.  Hell, it's sick stuff, that's all you need to know."


        "But I'm dead."


        "Okay, well, we're talking, aren't we?  You can talk, so are you dead?"  The goat shook his head.
        "I wish I could remember if we win or if it was Dustin Hoffman."


        Hannah cried.  "Why do I have to die again?"  She wailed and her legs fell into
        flux and she sunk into the floor.  *MOH-MOHHH-MAO-MAOOO.*


        Dr. Cham had forceably yanked on a plush handle, which unlocked and slid open like a breadbox.
        He reached his hands inside and found a keyboard firmly bolted deep inside.


        "That's it," he said and pulled up @irb@, which appeared on a display to the left of his
        concealed typing.  He checked the Ruby version.


        <pre>
         irb> RUBY_VERSION
           => "1.8.3"
        </pre>


        Ruby was up-to-date.  What else could he do?  Scanning @constants@ and @class_variables@ was pointless.
        The only reason that had worked with the @Elevator@ class was because someone had left @irb@ running
        with their classes still loaded.


        He had just loaded this @irb@, so no special classes were available yet.  He had to find some classes.
        He started by loading the @`rbconfig`@ file to get an idea of what Ruby's settings were.


        <pre>
         irb> require 'rbconfig'
           => true
         irb> Config::CONFIG
           => {"abs_srcdir"=>"$(ac_abs_srcdir)", "sitedir"=>"bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby", ... }
        </pre>


        Too much information to sort through there.  The @Config::CONFIG@ constant is a Hash that
        contains every environment setting used to setup Ruby.  You can find the operating system
        name at @Config::CONFIG['host_os']@.  The directory where core Ruby libraries are stored
        can be found at @Config::CONFIG['rubylibdir']@.  Ruby programs can store helper files at
        @Config::CONFIG['datadir']@.
        

        What Dr. Cham really needed, though, was a list of all the libraries that aren't core Ruby
        libraries.  Libraries which were installed by The Originals or whoever manned this console.
        He checked a few global variables for this information.


        <pre>
         irb> $"
           => ["irb.rb", "e2mmap.rb", "irb/init.rb", ... "rbconfig.rb"]
         irb> $:
           => ["bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9", "bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/i686-unknown",
               "bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby", "bay://Ruby/lib/1.9", 
               "bay://Ruby/lib/1.9/i686-unknown", "."]
        </pre>


        Aha, good.  Dr. Cham stroked his beard and looked over his @irb@ session.  The @$"@ global variable
        contains an Array of every library which has been loaded with @require@.  Most of these libraries
        had been loaded by @irb@.  He had loaded @'rbconfig.rb'@ earlier, though.


        The @$:@ global variable, which can also be accessed as @$LOAD_PATH@, contains a list of all
        the directories which Ruby will check when you try to load a file with @require@.  When Dr.
        Cham ran @require 'rbconfig'@, Ruby checked each directory in order.


        <pre>
         bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/rbconfig.rb
         bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/i686-unknown/rbconfig.rb (*)
         bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/rbconfig.rb
         bay://Ruby/lib/1.9/rbconfig.rb
         bay://Ruby/lib/1.9/i686-unknown/rbconfig.rb
         ./rbconfig.rb
        </pre>


        The second path was where Ruby ended up finding the rbconfig.rb file.  Dr. Cham guessed that
        the first five paths were *absolute paths*.  These were paths to directories on a drive called
        @bay@.  Absolute paths may vary on your system.  On Windows, absolute paths will start with
        a drive letter.  On Linux, absolute paths start with a slash.


        The directory @"."@ indicates a *relative path*.  The lone period represents the current
        work directory.  The directory where Dr. Cham started up @irb@.  So, after Ruby has searched
        all the standard places, it checks the current directory.


        The goat had peeked his head around Dr. Cham and was watching all these instructions
        transpire, as he licked his lips to keep his salivations from running all over the monitors
        and glossy buttons.  He had been interjecting a few short cheers (along the lines of:
        _No, not that_ or _Yes, yes, right_ or _Okay, well, your choice_), but now he was
        fully involved, recommending code, "Try @require 'setup'@ or, no, try
        @3 * 5@.  Make sure that basic math works."


        "Of course the math works," said Dr. Cham.  "Let me be, I need to find some useful classes."


        "It's a basic sanity test," said the goat.  "Just try it.  Do @3 * 5@ and see what
        comes up."


        Dr. Cham caved.


        <pre>
         irb> 3 * 5
           => 15
        </pre>


        "Okay, great!  We're in business!" the goat tossed his furry face about in glee.
        

        Dr. Cham patted the goat's head, "Well done.  We can continue."


        <pre>
         irb> Dir.chdir( "bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/" )
           => 0
         irb> Dir["./*.{rb}"]
           => ['endertromb.rb', 'mindreader.rb', 'wishmaker.rb']
        </pre>


        Dr. Cham had use @chdir@ to change the current working directory over the the first
        path listed in @$LOAD_PATH@.  This first path in @site_ruby@ is a common place to store
        custom classes.


        Here were the three legendary classes that my daughter's organ instructor had inscribed
        for me earlier in this chapter.  And, Dr. Cham, having read this selfsame chapter, recognized
        these three pieces of the system immediately.


        The @Endertromb@ class which contained the mysteries of this planet's powers.  The @MindReader@
        class which, upon scanning the minds of its inhabitants, read each mind's contents.  And, finally,
        the crucial @WishMaker@ class which powered the granting of ten-letter wishes, should the wish
        ever find its way to the core of Endertromb.


        "How about @4 * 56 + 9@?" asked the goat.  "We don't know if it can do compound expressions."


        "I've got the @MindReader@ right here," said Dr. Cham.  "And I have the @WishMaker@ here next to it.
        This planet can read minds.  And this planet can make wishes.  Now, let's see if it can do both at
        the same time."
