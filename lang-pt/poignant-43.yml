      An Evening of Unobstructed Voltage: >

        I dug up this article from _The Consistent Reminder_, a Connecticut newspaper
        which ran the four star review of Dr. Cham.  Midgie Dare, the book reviewer
        who suddenly opened her critical eye to anything tangible, praised the Doctor for his
        manners and innovations in the very same daily edition that she defamed cantaloupe and docked
        Manitoba for having crackly telephone service.


        I got a kick out of the end of her article.  Here you go.


        bq. He dismounted his horse with unquestionable care for anyone who
        might be in the vicinity.  Attentive of all sides, he lowered himself
        from the saddle gently, slowing to a pace which must be measured in
        micrometers per second to be appreciated.


        bq. Those of us in his company
        found ourselves with maws agape, watching his boot touch down upon
        the ground.  So precise and clean a step that it seemed it would never
        meet the earth, only hover slight above it.  Then, before the landing
        had actually registered with any of us, we were off to the cuisine, whisked
        away in the shroud of gaiety that was always right in front of Harold Cham,
        always just behind him, and most especially concentrate directly
        in his own luminary self.


        bq. He also carried loosely at his side a capitally ignorant statesman's
        daughter, who spared us no leave from her constant criticisms of atheists
        and railway routes.


        bq. "At home, my efforts to light a candle were trounced upon
        by further train rumblings, which thrusted the match in my hand nearer the curtains!"
        She derided Dr. Cham for his waning grip
        on her forearm and became jealous when he was able to tune into a pleasurable
        woman's voice on the radio once we returned to the residence.


        bq. The dusk did settle, however, and we found ourselves in a communal daze beneath
        the thick particles of cotton drift that wafted through the polished piano room,
        quite entertained by the _Afternoon Nap Program_, which played their phonograph
        so quietly at the station that we could only hear the scratching of dead Napoleon's
        sleeves across the bedsheets.  I felt a great shriek inside me at the thought!
        Still, on yonder chairs, the two lovers kept an abrupt distance between themselves and 
        I felt encompassed by Dr. Cham's warm gaze and his playful tip of the sherry glass.
