        Variables which start with the American cash sign are global variables.  They can
        be seen from anywhere in the program, *from inside any scope*.  (Dr. Cham used this
        variable while snooping around The Originals' computer bay.)


        So why does the *cash sign followed by a colon* represent an array of *all directories
        where Ruby will search when you try to load a file with @require@*?  The cash sign
        means "global."  But why the colon?


        Historically, on many operating systems, a list of directories contains colons which
        separated each entry.  I like to see the colon as a pair of eyes, scanning the directories
        for files.  We store our lookout list behind the eyes.


        Here's a few more special global variables:


        <pre>
         irb> $"      # The $" variable contains all files which have been loaded with `require'
           => ["irb.rb", "e2mmap.rb", "irb/init.rb", ... "rbconfig.rb"]
                      # These files are stored somewhere else, but their code is being used
                      # in this program.  Much like quoting someone else's work -- these are the
                      # footnotes -- hence the double-quote.

         irb> $0      # The $0 variable contains the running program's filename.
           => "irb"   # A zero can be considered the beginning of a number count.
                      # This variable answers the question, "Where did this program begin?"

         irb> $*      # The $* variable contains all the arguments passed into a program.
           => ['--prompt', 'simple']
                      # This one is easy to remember, if you remember that Ruby methods
                      # also use the asterisk to capture arguments into an array.

         # The $! contains the current exception raised.
         # The exclamation indicates a state of alarm.  An exception!
         irb> begin
         irb>   raise TypeError, "I don't believe this information."
         irb> rescue
         irb>   p $!
         irb> end
           => #<TypeError: I don't believe this information.>

         # The $@ contains the current backtrace, if an exception was raised.
         # The backtrace shows were Ruby was _at_ when the exception fired.
         irb> begin
         irb>   raise TypeError, "I don't believe this information."
         irb> rescue
         irb>   p $@
         irb> end
           => ["(irb):25:in `irb_binding'", "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/workspace.rb:52:in `irb_binding'", 
               "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/workspace.rb:52"]
        </pre>


        "I don't remember you."  Blix looked at the gorilla with great interest.
        "Are you one of R.K.'s kids or something?"


        "Oh, come on!" said Fox Small, holding up a bill with an exclamation mark on it up to the gorilla's nose.
        "Don't tell me this means _nothing_ to you!  This one is probably _really important_
        since it has an exclamation on it.  Maybe it pays for emergency stuff!  Hospital
        bills or something!"


        *"Yeah, surgery!"* said Fox Tall.


        The gorilla looked at the foxes with disgust from under the brim of his cap.  "No,
        you're wrong.  You can't pay for surgeries with that."


        "But you see our point," said the small fox.  He grabbed some of the other bills.
        "And you say this bill _cannot_ pay for surgeries?  Well that sounds like it has
        a specific _non-surgery-related_ purpose.  Now, the question mark one.  Oh, what would that one be for?"

        
        "Hey, give me those," the gorilla snatched at the bills over the counter, but 
        his long thumb kept getting in the way and every time he thought he had grabbed bills, 
        it turned out he had only grabbed his long thumb.


        "Hey, hey, look, he's mad," said Fox Tall, happily clapping.  "I wonder why.  Did you notice
        how mad he started getting once we mentioned all these interesting meanings?  *We're on to
        you!  We figured out your game so fast!"*


        "We totally did!" said Fox Small, one of his elbows caught in the grip of the gorilla,
        the other arm waving a bill that featured an underscore.
        "This one's for buying floor supplies, maybe even big rolls of tile and linoleum."


        "See," said Fox Tall, working to pry the gorilla's fingers free, "we just have to figure out which is more expensive:
        surgery or linoleum!  This is _so easy!"_


        *"NO IT'S NOT!"* yelled the gorilla, yanking at the smaller fox and battering the
        fox with his palms.  *"YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MONKEY MONEY!!  YOU DON'T EVEN _HAVE_
        YOUR OWN KINDS OF MONEY!!"*


        "We could _easily_ have our own kinds of money!" said Fox Tall, taking the chimp's
        hat and tossing it to the back of the room, where it sailed behind a wall of safety
        deposit boxes.  "And -- _your hat is outta here!_"


        "Come on, give him back his bills," said Blix, waving his arms helplessly from the
        sidelines.  "We could really use this guy's help."


        "Stop hitting me!" screamed the littlest fox.  "I've almost figured out this one
        with the dots on it!!"


        Suddenly, with great precision and without warning, Fox Tall grabbed the monkey's nose
        and slammed his face down against the counter.  The pens and inkpads on its surface
        rattled and "Bam!" said the fox.  The gorilla's eyes spun sleepily
        as his arms... then his neck... then his head slithered to the floor behind the counter.
