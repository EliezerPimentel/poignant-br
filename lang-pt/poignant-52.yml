        Paij-ree was an enterprising young Endertromaltoek.  He hammered animal bones into long,
        glistening trumpets with deep holes that were plugged by corks the musicians banded to
        their fingers.  Sure, he only sold three of those units, but he was widely reviled as
        a freelance scholar, a demonic one, for he was of a poorer class and the poor only
        ever acquired their brilliance through satanic practice.  Of course, they were right,
        indeed, he did have a bargain with the dark mages, whom he kept appointments with annually,
        enduring torturous hot springs, bathing as they chanted spells.


        He adored his father, even as his father deteriorated into but a gyroscope.  He idolized the
        man's work and spent his own small earnings playing the lottery.  He loved to watch the
        numerals, each painted upon hollow clay balls, rise in the _robloch_ (which is any fluid,
        pond or spill that has happened to withstand the presence of ghosts), the great bankers
        tying them together on a silver string, reading them in order.


        Even today, Paij-ree paints the scenes with crude strokes of black ink on sheets of aluminum 
        foil.  It is very touching to see him caught up in the preciousness of his memory, but I don't 
        know exactly why he does it on aluminum foil.  His drawings rip too easily.  Paij-ree himself
        gets mixed up and will serve you crumbcake right off of some of this art, even after it has
        been properly framed.  So many things about him are troubling and absurd and downright wretched.


        The disease spread over his father's form and marshy weeds covered his father's hands
        and face.  The moss pulled his spine up into a rigid uprightness.  So thick was the
        growth over his head that he appeared to wear a shrub molded into a bowler's hat.  He
        also called himself by a new name -- *Quos* -- and he healed the people he touched, leaving
        a pile of full-blooded, greenly-cheeked villages in his wake as he travelled the
        townships.  Many called him The Mossiah and wept on his feet, which wet the buds and caused
        him to weed into the ground.  This made him momentarily angry, he harshly jogged his legs
        to break free and thrashed his fists wildly in the sky, bringing down a storm of lightning
        shards upon these pitiful.


        Paij-ree was apart from the spiritual odysseys of his father (in fact, thought the man
        dead), so he only saw the decay of the lottery without its captain present.  Here is
        where Paij-ree went to work, reviving the dead lottery of his family.


        h3. Gambling with Fewer Fingers


        The city was crowded with people who had lost interest in the lottery.  The weather
        had really worn everyone down as well.  Such terrible rain flooding their cellars.
        The entire city was forced to move up one story.  You'd go to put the cap back on your
        pen and you'd ruin the pen, since the cap was already full of slosh.  Everyone was depleted,
        many people drowned.


        Paij-ree found himself wasting his days in a quadruple bunkbed, the only furniture that
        managed to stay above sea level.  He slept on the top bed.  The third bed up was dry as
        well, so he let a homeless crater gull nest upon it.  The gull didn't need the whole bed,
        so Paij-ree also kept his calculators and pencils down there.


        At first, these were very dark times for both of them, and they insisted on remaining
        haggard at all times.  Paij-ree became obsessed with his fingernails, kept them long and
        pristine, while the rest of him deteriorated under a suit of hair.  In the company of
        Paij-ree, the crater gull learned his own eccentrity and plucked all the feathers on
        the right side of his body.  He looked like a cutaway diagram.


        They learned to have happier times.  Paij-ree carved a flute from the wall with his nails and played
        it often.  Mostly he played his relaxed ballads during the daytime.  In the evening,
        they pounded the wall and shook the bed frame in time to his songs.  The gull went
        nuts when he played a certain four notes and he looped this section repeatedly,
        watching the gull swoop and circle in ectasy.  Paij-ree could hardly keep his
        composure over the effect the little tune had and he couldn't keep it together,
        fell all apart, slobbering and horse-giggling.


        Paij-ree called the gull _Eb-F-F-A_, after that favorite song.


        Friendship can be a very good catalyst for progress.  A friend can find traits in you
        that no one else can.  It's like they searched your person and somehow came up
        with five full sets of silverware you never knew were there.  And even though
        that friend may not understand why you had these utensils concealed, it's still a
        great feat, worth honoring.


        While _Eb-F-F-A_ didn't find silverware, he did find something else.  A
        pile of something else.  Since Paij-ree was stranded on the quadruple bed, the gull
        would scout around for food.  One day, he flew down upon a barrel, floating over where
        the toolshed had been.  _Eb-F-F-A_ walked on top of the barrel, spinning it back to Paij-ree's
        house and they cracked it open, revealing Paij-ree's lost collection of duck bills.


        Yes, real duck bills. (_Eb-F-F-A_ was esophagizing his squawks, remaining calm,
        sucking beads of sweat back into his forehead -- ducks were not _of his chosen feather_,
        but still in the species.)  Paij-ree clapped gleefully, absolutely, he had intended
        to shingle his house with these, they could have deflected a bit of the torrent.
        Probably not much, nothing to cry about.


        And the roof glue was at the barrel's bottom and they were two enterprising
        bunkmates with time to kill, so they made a raft from the previously-quacked
        lip shades.  And off they were to the country!  Stirring through a real mess of
        city and soup.  How strange it was to hit a beach and find out it was just the old
        dirt road passed Toffletown Junction.


        In the country, they sold.  It was always a long walk to the next plantation,
        but there would be a few buyers up in the mansion ("Welcome to The Mansion Built on Beets",
        they'd say or, "The Mansion Built on Cellophane Substitutes -- don't you know how
        harmful real cellophane can be?")  And one of the families wrapped up some excess
        jelly and ham in some cellophane for the two travellers.  And they almost died one day later
        because of it.
        

        Then, when the heat came and, as the first countryside lottery was at nigh,
        a farmer called to them from his field, as he stood by his grazing cow.
        Paij-ree and _Eb-F-F-A_ wandered out to him, murmuring to each other as to
        whether they should offer him the Wind-Beaten Ticket Special or whether he
        might want to opt in to winning Risky Rosco's Original Homestyle Country 
        Medallion.


        But the farmer waved them down as he approached, "No, put your calculators and probability
        wheels away.  It's for my grazledon."  He meant his cow.  The Endertromb version:
        twice as much flesh, twice as meaty, doesn't produce milk, produces paper plates.  Still,
        it grazes.


        "Your grazledon (poh-kon-ic) wants a lucky ticket?" asked Paij-ree.


        "He saw you two and got real excited," said the farmer.  "He doesn't know numbers,
        but he understands luck a bit.  He almost got hit by a doter plane one day and, when
        I found him, he just gave shrug.  It was like he said, 'Well, I guess that worked out
        okay.'"


        "The whole (shas-op) lottery is numer-(ig-ig)-ic," said Paij-ree.  "Does he know
        (elsh) notes?  My eagle knows (losh) notes."  Paij-ree whistled at the crater gull,
        who cooed back a sustained _D_.


        The farmer couldn't speak to his grazledon's tonal awareness, so Paij-ree sent the gull
        to find out (_D-D-D-A-D_, _go-teach-the-gra-zle_) while he hacked some notes into
        his calculator.

        No need for the animal's tickets to behave drastically different from the traditional
        tickets.  The @AnimalLottoTicket@ class is internally different, but exposes the same
        methods seen in the original @LotteryTicket@ class.
        The @score@ method is even identical to the @score@ method from the old @LotteryTicket@
        class.


        Instead of using a class variable to store the musical note list, they're stored in
        a constant called @AnimalLottoTicket::NOTES@.  Variables change and the note list
        shouldn't change.  Constants are designed to stay the same.  You can still change the
        constant, but you'll have to be tricky or Ruby will speak up.


        <pre>
         irb> AnimalLottoTicket::NOTES = [:TOOT, :TWEET, :BLAT]
         (irb):3: warning: already initialized constant NOTES
           => [:TOOT, :TWEET, :BLAT]
        </pre>


        The gull came back with the grazledon, his name was Merphy, he was thrilled to play chance,
        he puffed his face dreamily, whistled five and six notes
        in series, they all held his collar, pulled him close to the calculator and let him breathe
        three notes, then they choked the bedosh outta him until his ticket was printed and 
        everything was nicely catalogued inside @@@tickets['merphy']@.  Thankyou, see ya at the draw!


        So, the fever of the lottery became an epidemic among the simple minds of the animals.  
        Paij-ree saved his costs, used the same @LotteryDraw@ class he'd used in the corporate environment of
        the lottery from his childhood.  And soon enough, the animals were making their own
        music and their own maps and films.


        "What about The Originals?" I asked Paij-ree.  "They must have hated your animals!"


        But he winced sourly and pinched his forehead.  "I am an Original.  You as well.
        Do we (ae-o) hate any of them?"


        Not too long after the lottery ended, Paij-ree felt the crater gull _Eb-F-F-A_
        lighting upon his shoulder, which whistled an urgent and sad _C-Eb-D C-A-Eb_.
        These desparate notes sent an organ roll of chills straight through Paij-ree.  Had the
        King God of Potted Soil, Our Beloved Topiary, *the Mossiah Quos*, Literal Father of
        That Man Who Would Be My Daughter's Organ Instructor -- had he truly come to his end?
        How could this be?  Could the great arbors no longer nourish him and guide the moist crosswinds
        to him?  Or did his own spindly lichen hedge up his way and grow against his breathing?


        _You never mind_, went the tune of the gull.  _He has detoriated and weakened and fallen in the
        lit door of your home cottage.  His tendrils needing and crying for the day to not end.
        For the sun to stay fixed and wide and attentive._


        Plor-ian, the house attendant, kept the pitchers coming and Quos stayed well watered
        until Paij-ree arrived to survey the decaying buds of soft plant and the emerging face of
        his father, the lottery captain.  His skin deeply pocked like an overly embroidered pillow.
        Great shoots springing from his sleeves now curled back with lurching thirst.


        Paij-ree combed back the longer stems around his father's eyes and those coming from the
        corners of his mouth.  While I'd like to tell you that Paij-ree's tears rolled down
        his sleeves and into the pours of his father, rejuvenating and restoring the grassy gentleman:
        I cannot say this.


        Rather, Paij-ree's tears rolled down his sleeves and into the creaking clapboard floor,
        nourishing the vile weeds, energizing the dark plant matter, which literally lept through
        the floor at night and strangled Our Quos.  Yank, pull, crack.  And that was his skull.


        So Paij-ree could never be called Wert-ree or Wert-plo after that.
