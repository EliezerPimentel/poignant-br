        Paij-ree era um jovem e audaz Endertromaltoek.  Ele martelava ossos de animais em longos,
        deslumbrantes trompetes com oríficios profundos que eram conectados por cortiças que os
        músicos uniam a seus dedos.  Obviamente ele vendeu apenas três destas unidades, mas ele estava
        amplamente injuriado pois um acadêmico autônomo, um tipo demônico, para ele era de uma classe
        mais pobre e os pobres só conseguiam seu brilhantismo através de práticas satânicas.  Claro,
        estavam certos, de fato, ele tinha um acordo com os magos negros, com quem ele mantinha
        encontros anuais, sofrendo atormentadoras primaveras ardentes, banhando-se enquanto
        eles lançavam feitiços.


        Ele adorava seu pai, mesmo sabendo que seu pai deteriorara em nada mais que um giroscópio.
        Ele idolatrava o trabalho do homem e gastava seus pequenos ganhos jogando na loteria.  Ele
        adorava assistir os numerais, cada um pintado sobre bolas de argila ocas, levantadas do _robloch_
        (que é qualquer tipo de fluido, reservatório ou entorno que vem resiste a presença de fantasmas), 
        os grandes banqueiros amarrando-as num cordão de prata, lendo-as em ordem.


        Mesmo hoje. Paij-ree pinta as cenas com pinceladas cruas de tinta preta em folhas de papel alumínio.  
        É bastante tocante ver o que ele recuperou na preciosidade de sua memória, mas não sei dizer 
        exatamente porque ele o faz em folhas de papel alumínio.  Seus desenhos rasgam com bastante facilidade.  
        O próprio Paij-ree fica confuso e lhe servirá bolo de pão usando esta arte, mesmo após ela ter sido
        corretamente emoldurada.  Então, são tantas coisas sobre ele que são problemáticas e absurdas e
        absolutamente miseráveis.


        A doença espalhou-se sobre a forma de seu pai e ervas pantanosas cobriam as mãos e a face
        de seu pai.  O musgo empurrava sua espinha para uma rígida verticalidade.  Tão espesso era
        o turmo sobre sua cabeça que ele aparentava vestir um arbusto num chapéu de lançador.  Ele
        também chamava a sis mesmo por um novo nome -- *Quos* -- e ele curava as pessoas em que tocava, 
        deixando uma pilha de vilas cheias de vida no seu caminho a medida que viajava pelas cidades.
        Muitos o chamavam de Musgossias e choravam sob seus pés, o que molhava os brotos e o levava
        a germinar no solo.  Isto o deixava momentaneamente irritado, ele duramente chacoalhava suas
        pernas para libertar-se e selvagemente levava suas mãos ao céu, trazendo um trovão de fragmentos 
        de luz sobre estes patéticos 


        Paij-ree estava distante das odisséias espirituais de seu pai (de fato, pensou o homem 
        morto), então ele apenas viu a decadência da loteria sem a presença de seu capitão.  
        É neste ponto em que Paij-ree foi ao trabalho, revivendo a falecida loteria de sua família.
        Paij-ree was apart from the spiritual odysseys of his father (in fact, thought the man
        dead), so he only saw the decay of the lottery without its captain present.  Here is
        where Paij-ree went to work, reviving the dead lottery of his family.


        h3. Gambling with Fewer Fingers


        The city was crowded with people who had lost interest in the lottery.  The weather
        had really worn everyone down as well.  Such terrible rain flooding their cellars.
        The entire city was forced to move up one story.  You'd go to put the cap back on your
        pen and you'd ruin the pen, since the cap was already full of slosh.  Everyone was depleted,
        many people drowned.


        Paij-ree found himself wasting his days in a quadruple bunkbed, the only furniture that
        managed to stay above sea level.  He slept on the top bed.  The third bed up was dry as
        well, so he let a homeless crater gull nest upon it.  The gull didn't need the whole bed,
        so Paij-ree also kept his calculators and pencils down there.


        At first, these were very dark times for both of them, and they insisted on remaining
        haggard at all times.  Paij-ree became obsessed with his fingernails, kept them long and
        pristine, while the rest of him deteriorated under a suit of hair.  In the company of
        Paij-ree, the crater gull learned his own eccentrity and plucked all the feathers on
        the right side of his body.  He looked like a cutaway diagram.


        They learned to have happier times.  Paij-ree carved a flute from the wall with his nails and played
        it often.  Mostly he played his relaxed ballads during the daytime.  In the evening,
        they pounded the wall and shook the bed frame in time to his songs.  The gull went
        nuts when he played a certain four notes and he looped this section repeatedly,
        watching the gull swoop and circle in ectasy.  Paij-ree could hardly keep his
        composure over the effect the little tune had and he couldn't keep it together,
        fell all apart, slobbering and horse-giggling.


        Paij-ree called the gull _Eb-F-F-A_, after that favorite song.


        Friendship can be a very good catalyst for progress.  A friend can find traits in you
        that no one else can.  It's like they searched your person and somehow came up
        with five full sets of silverware you never knew were there.  And even though
        that friend may not understand why you had these utensils concealed, it's still a
        great feat, worth honoring.


        While _Eb-F-F-A_ didn't find silverware, he did find something else.  A
        pile of something else.  Since Paij-ree was stranded on the quadruple bed, the gull
        would scout around for food.  One day, he flew down upon a barrel, floating over where
        the toolshed had been.  _Eb-F-F-A_ walked on top of the barrel, spinning it back to Paij-ree's
        house and they cracked it open, revealing Paij-ree's lost collection of duck bills.


        Yes, real duck bills. (_Eb-F-F-A_ was esophagizing his squawks, remaining calm,
        sucking beads of sweat back into his forehead -- ducks were not _of his chosen feather_,
        but still in the species.)  Paij-ree clapped gleefully, absolutely, he had intended
        to shingle his house with these, they could have deflected a bit of the torrent.
        Probably not much, nothing to cry about.


        And the roof glue was at the barrel's bottom and they were two enterprising
        bunkmates with time to kill, so they made a raft from the previously-quacked
        lip shades.  And off they were to the country!  Stirring through a real mess of
        city and soup.  How strange it was to hit a beach and find out it was just the old
        dirt road passed Toffletown Junction.


        In the country, they sold.  It was always a long walk to the next plantation,
        but there would be a few buyers up in the mansion ("Welcome to The Mansion Built on Beets",
        they'd say or, "The Mansion Built on Cellophane Substitutes -- don't you know how
        harmful real cellophane can be?")  And one of the families wrapped up some excess
        jelly and ham in some cellophane for the two travellers.  And they almost died one day later
        because of it.
        

        Then, when the heat came and, as the first countryside lottery was at nigh,
        a farmer called to them from his field, as he stood by his grazing cow.
        Paij-ree and _Eb-F-F-A_ wandered out to him, murmuring to each other as to
        whether they should offer him the Wind-Beaten Ticket Special or whether he
        might want to opt in to winning Risky Rosco's Original Homestyle Country 
        Medallion.


        But the farmer waved them down as he approached, "No, put your calculators and probability
        wheels away.  It's for my grazledon."  He meant his cow.  The Endertromb version:
        twice as much flesh, twice as meaty, doesn't produce milk, produces paper plates.  Still,
        it grazes.


        "Your grazledon (poh-kon-ic) wants a lucky ticket?" asked Paij-ree.


        "He saw you two and got real excited," said the farmer.  "He doesn't know numbers,
        but he understands luck a bit.  He almost got hit by a doter plane one day and, when
        I found him, he just gave shrug.  It was like he said, 'Well, I guess that worked out
        okay.'"


        "The whole (shas-op) lottery is numer-(ig-ig)-ic," said Paij-ree.  "Does he know
        (elsh) notes?  My eagle knows (losh) notes."  Paij-ree whistled at the crater gull,
        who cooed back a sustained _D_.


        The farmer couldn't speak to his grazledon's tonal awareness, so Paij-ree sent the gull
        to find out (_D-D-D-A-D_, _go-teach-the-gra-zle_) while he hacked some notes into
        his calculator.
