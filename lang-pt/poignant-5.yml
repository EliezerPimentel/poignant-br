      I'll try not to feel utterly rejected if this book doesn't capture
      your fancy.  I might experience a few long days of emptiness, accompanied
      with profuse weeping, but other than that I'll be fine.  It's at least
      comforting to know that the following fine texts cover my topic and will
      doubtless fill you with Ruby lust:

      Now, if you can't seem to find the contents link on the left-hand side of the page,
      then here's a link to the "first page":chapter-1.html
      of the (Poignant) Guide.  If you want to venture onto my other projects, go
