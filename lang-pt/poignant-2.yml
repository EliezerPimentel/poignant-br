      At my local Barnes and Noble, there is a huge wall of Java books just waiting
      to tip over and crush me one day.  And one day it will.  At the rate things are going,
      one day that bookcase will be tall enough to crush us all.  It might even loop the world
      several times, crushing previous editions of the same Java books over and over again.
