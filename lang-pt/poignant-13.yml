    - How Books Start: >

        Now, if you ever have read a book, you know that no book can properly start without an exorbitant
        amount of synergy.  Yes, synergy.  Maybe you didn't know this.  Synergy means that you and I are
        supposed to cooperate to make this a great reading experience.  


        We start off the book by getting
        along well in the Introduction.  This togetherness, this *synergy*, propels us through the book,
        with me guiding you on your way.  You give me a reassuring nod or snicker to indicate your progress.


        I'm Peter Pan holding your hand.  Come on, Wendy!  Second star to the right and on till morning.


        One problem here.  I don't get along well with people.  I don't hold hands very well.  


        Any of my staff will tell you.  At the Opening Ceremonies of This Book (a catered event
        with stadium seating), I discovered that the cucumber sandwiches weren't served in tea towels.
        As a result, the butter hadn't set with the cucumbers right... Anyways, I made a big scene and 
        set fire to some of the advertising trucks outside.  I smashed this spotlight to pieces and
        so on.  I had this loud maniacal laughing thing going on deep into that night.  It was a real mess.


        But, since I don't get along well with people, I hadn't invited anyone but myself to the Opening
        Ceremonies of This Book.  So it wasn't really that embarassing.   I kept it under wraps and no
        one found out about the whole ordeal.


        So you've got to know that *synergy* doesn't actually mean *synergy* in this book.  I can't do normal *synergy*.
        No, in this book, *synergy* means *cartoon foxes*.  What I'm saying is: this book will be
        starting off with an exorbitant amount of *cartoon foxes*.


        And I will be counting on you to turn them into *synergy*.
