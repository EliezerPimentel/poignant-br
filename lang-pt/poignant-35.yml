      Excerpt from The Scarf Eaters: >

        (_do Capítulo V: Um Homem de Uniforme_.)


        Em Abril, the callow lilies came back.  They stretched their baby angel wings out
        and reached for the world.  Gently, their tendrils caressed the sullen fence posts
        until even they lilted lovelier.


        Da janela do seu quarto, Lara olhava os lírios exude their staunch femininity.
        She slipped the tassels of a fresh, carpathian, embroidered scarf into her mouth and 
        ate slowly. The long cloth slid down her throat and tickled as it snaked along her
        esophagus.  She giggled and burped.


        Oh, how the flora drew her in.  Looking at flowers went so well with being a teenage girl. 
        She wanted to paint them, so she opened a new Flash template.  A blank movie this time.


        She set her cursor loose in the garden of her movie's viewable area.  Vector white lines
        below shorter vector yellow lines.  She selected the white lines and grouped them together.
        She even moved them to a new layer entitled "Cry, Baby Angel, Cry."  Then she
        converted them into a graphic object and moved them to the library.


        She felt a warm chill as she moved the long, white petals to her movie's library.  It
        felt so official.  _I choose you.  I name you.  Dwell in the comfort of my palace forevermore._
        

        Heh.  Ela riu.  Colorado Springs was hardly a "palace."
        

        Since they had moved, Dad had only been home once.  He had barged through the front door in
        full uniform and had given quite a start to both Lara and her mother.  Her mother had even dropped
        a head of lettuce -- which head she had just finished washing -- in a pitcher of Lick-M-Aid.  
        

        The pitcher was just wide enough for the lettuce and it lodged in there pretty good.
        Dad came over and yanked at the moist head for sometime until declaring it FUBAR, in a
        voice both bemused and then crestfallen.  He tossed the clotted spout in the trash bin.


        It was only later that day that Lara's mother realized that she could have simply halved the
        lettuce with an electric knife.  Dad laughed and slapped his forehead.  He then went
        around and slapped Lara's forehead, and her mother's too, affectionately.


        "We just weren't thinking, were we?" is what he said.  "And who dares blame us?  We're
        a real family today.  And we shouldn't have to do anything else on the day we got
        our family back."


        O sorriso de Lara refletiu no vidro do monitor.  Ela escolheu o programa de texto
        em em fonte serif tamanho 42 escreveu: "Pai."  She created a path for it and let it tween off the
        right side of the screen.  She cried long after it was gone.
