        "Who's Lester?" said the Fox Small.


        "Lester's my cab driver!  He parked at the base of Dwemthy's Array!!"  The rabbit ricocheted madly like a screensaver
        for a supercomputer.  _"Just ask Dwemthy!!"_


        "Well," said the Fox Small.  He turned back to look up at Fox Tall, who was sitting straight and looking far into
        the distance.  "Wait, they have a parking lot on Dwemthy's Array?"
        
        
        *"YEP!!*  And a pretzel stand!!"


        "But, it's _an Array_?  Do they sell churros?"


        *"CHOCOLAVA!!"* bleeted the rabbit.


        "What about those glow-in-the-dark ropes that you can put in your hair?  Or you can just hold them by your side or up
        in the air--"


        *"BRAIDQUEST!!"*


        "You should get a cut of the salesman's commission," spoke Fox Small.  "Folks came out to see you kill the dragon, right?"


        *"BUT!!*  I don't operate the tongs that actually extract the chocolava."


        "I'm just sayin.  You *do* operate the killing mechanism.  So you _have a stake_ in the ensalada."


        "OH NO!!  I left my favorite lettuce leaves in Dwemthy's Array!!" squealed the rabbit, twirling like a celebratory saber through
        the quaking oak.  Distantly: "Or Lester's trunk, maybe?"
        
        
        "You know-- Gheesh, can you stay put??" said Fox Small.
        
        
        "My radio," said Fox Tall, stirring to life for a moment, "in my pickup."  The glaze still seeping from his eyes.  His stare quivered and
        set back into his face, recalling another time and place.  A drive out to Maryland.  Sounds of Lionel Richie coming in
        so clearly.  The wipers going a bit too fast.  He pulls up to a house.  His mother answers the door.
        She is a heavily fluffed fox.  Tears and makeup.


        Slumping back down, "That porcupine is changing my presets."


        The rabbit bounded up on to the armrest of the park bench and spoke closely.  *"BUT!!* Soon I will feast on
        drgn's head and the juices of drgn's tongue!!"  The rabbit sat still and held his paws kindly.


        "(Which I hope will taste like cinnamon bears,)" whispered the rabbit, intimately.


        "I love cinammon," said Fox Small.  "I should go killing with you some time."


        "You should," said the rabbit and the eyes shine-shined.


        "Although, salivating over a tongue.  You don't salivate over it, do you?"


        "I DO!!" and the rabbit got so excited that Sticky Whip shot out of his eyes.  (More on Sticky Whip in a later sidebar.
        Don't let me forget.  See also: _The Purist's Compendium to Novelty Retinal Cremes_ by Jory Patrick Sobgoblin, available wherever animal
        attachment clips are sold.)


        "Okay, you've hooked me.  I want to hear all about it," Fox Small declared.
        "Please, talk freely about the chimbly.  Oh, and Dwemthy.  Who is he?  What makes him tick?  Then maybe, if I'm still around after
        that, you can tell me about what makes rabbits tick, and maybe you can hold our hands through this whole missing truck ordeal.
        I need consolation more than anything else.  I could probably use religion right now.  I could use your personal bravery and
        this sense of accomplishment you exude.  Do you smoke a pipe?  Could be a handy tool to coax along the pontification we
        must engage in."


        And the rabbit began expounding upon Dwemthy and the legend of Dwemthy and the ways of Dwemthy.
        As with most stories of Dwemthy, the rabbit's tales were mostly embellishments.
        Smotchkkiss, there are delicacies which I alone must address.


        Please, never ask who Dwemthy is. Obviously he is a mastermind and would never disclose his location or true identity. He has sired dynasties. He has set living ogres aflame. Horses everywhere smell him at all times. Most of all, he knows carnal pleasures. And to think that this...


        This is his Array.

        _If you don't understand Dwemthy's Array, it is Dwemthy's fault. He designed the game to complicate our lives and were it simpler, it would not be the awe-inspiring quest we've come to cherish in our arms this very hour._


        Dwemthy's Array has a winding history of great depth.  It is not enough to simply say, "Dwemthy's
        Array," over and over and expect to build credentials from that act alone.  Come with me, I can take you back
        a couple years, back to the sixties where it all started with metaprogramming and the dolphins.


        You might be inclined to think that *metaprogramming* is another hacker word and was first overheard in private
        phone calls between fax machines.  Honest to God, I am here to tell you that it is stranger than that.
        Metaprogramming began with _taking drugs in the company of dolphins_.


        In the sixties, a prolific scientist named John C. Lilly began experimenting with his own senses,
        to uncover the workings of his body.  I can relate to this.  I do this frequently when I am standing
        in the middle of a road holding a pie or when I am hiding inside a cathedral.  I pause to examine
        my self.  This has proven to be nigh impossible.  I have filled three ruled pages with algebraic
        notation, none of which has explained anything.  The pie, incidentally, has been very easy to express
        mathematically.


        But the scientist Lilly went about his experiments otherwise.  He ingested LSD in the company of dolphins.
        Often in a dark, woeful isolation tank full of warm salt water.  Pretty bleak.  But it was science!  (Lest you think him
        criminal: until 1966, LSD was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories to any interested scientists, free of charge.)


        *Drugs, dolphins and deprivation.*  Which led to Lilly's foray into things meta.  He wrote books on
        mental programming, comparing humans and computers.  You may choose to ingest any substance you want during
        this next quote -- most likely you're reaching for the grain of salt -- but I assure you that there's
        no Grateful Dead show on the lawn and no ravers in the basement.


        bq. When one learns to learn, one is making models, using symbols, analogizing, making metaphors, in short, inventing and using language, mathematics, art, politics, business, etc. At the critical brain (cortex) size, languages and its consequences appear. To avoid the necessity of repeating learning to learn, symbols, metaphors, models each time, I symbolize the underlying idea in these operations as metaprogramming.


        bq(attrib). John C. Lilly, _Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer_, New York, 1972.


        We learn.  But first we learn to learn.  We setup programming in our mind which is the pathway to further
        programming.  (Lilly is largely talking about programming the brain and the nervous system, which he
        collectively called the _biocomputer_.)


        Lilly's metaprogramming was more about feeding yourself imagery, reinventing yourself, all that.
        This sort of thinking links directly to folks out there who dabble in shamanism, wave their hands over tarot cards and
        wake up early for karate class.  I guess you could say metaprogramming is New Age, but it's all settled down
        recently into a sleeping bag with plain old nerdiness.  (If you got here from a Google search for "C++ Metaprogramming",
        stick around, but I only ask that you _burn_ those neural pathways that originally invoked the search.  Many thanks.)


        Meta itself is spoken of no differently in your author's present day.


        bq. All sensuous response to reality is an interpretation of
        it.  Beetles and monkeys clearly interpret their world, and act on the basis of what they see.
        Our physical senses are themselves organs of interpretation.  What distinguishes us from our fellow
        animals is that we are able in turn to interpret these interpretations.  In that sense, all human
        language is meta-language.  It is a second-order reflection on the 'language' of our bodies --
        of our sensory apparatus.
         

        bq(attrib). Terry Eagleton, _After Theory_, London, 2003, ch. 3.


        To that end, you could say programming itself is a meta-language.  _All code_ speaks the language of action,
        of a plan which hasn't been played yet, but shortly will.  Stage directions for the players inside your
        machine.  I've waxed sentimental on this before.


        But now we're advancing our study, venturing into metaprogramming, but don't sweat it, *it's still just the
        Ruby you've seen already*, which is why Dwemthy feels no qualms thrusting it at you right away.  Soon enough it will be
        as easy to spot as addition or subtraction.  At first it may seem intensely bright, like you've stumbled across your
        first firefly, which has flown up in your face.  Then, it becomes just _a little bobbing light_ which makes living
        in Ohio so much nicer.
