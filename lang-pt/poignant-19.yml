      Seven Moments of Zen from My Life: >

        # 8 years old.  Just laying in bed, thinking.  And I realize.  
        _There's nothing stopping me from becoming a child dentist._

        # 21.  Found a pencil on the beach.  Embossed on it: _I cherish serenity._  Tucked
        it away into the inside breast pocket of my suit jacket.  Watched the waves come and
        recede.

        # 22.  Found a beetle in my bathroom that was just about to fall into a heating vent.
        Swiped him up.  Tailored him a little backpack out of a leaf and a thread.
        In the backpack: a skittle and a AAA battery.  That should last him.  Set him loose
        out by the front gate.

        # Three years of age.  Brushed aside the curtain.  Sunlight.

        # 14.  Riding my bike out on the pier with my coach who is jogging behind me
        as the sun goes down right after I knocked out Piston Honda in the original 
        Nintendo version of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.

        # 11.  Sick.  Watching Heathcliff on television.  For hours, it was Heathcliff.
        And he was able to come right up close to my face.  His head spun toward me.
        His face pulsed back and forth, up close, then off millions of miles away.
        Sound was gone.  In fractions of a second, Heathcliff filled the universe, then
        blipped off to the end of infinity.  I heard my mother's voice trying to cut
        through the cartoon.  Heathclose, Heathaway, Heathclose, Heathaway.
        It was a religious rave with a cat strobe and muffled bass of mother's voice.
        (I ran a fever of 105 that day.)

        # 18.  Bought myself a gigapet.  A duck.  Fed it for awhile.  Gave it a bath.
        Forgot about it for almost a couple months.  One day, while cleaning, I found a chain and he
        was there on the end.  Hey, little duck.  Mad freaky, hoppin' around with his hair out,
        squawking diagonal lines.  In a tuxedo.
