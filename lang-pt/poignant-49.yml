        "I haven't been to my planet in a long time.  It would be difficult to consider it my
        home at this stage."


        "Well, Warren Beatty is delightful.  His character is basically socially crippled.  He
        actually tries to kill himself, but Dustin Hoffman sits in the window sill and starts
        crying and singing this totally hilarious heartbreak song.  I've got it here, you
        should see it."


        "Can I get something to eat?" asked the Doctor.  And he still felt filthy.


        "How about we watch a film and you can have a buttermelon with tentacles?" said the goat.


        So, they worked their way back toward the goat's projector.  Back by the freezer locker,
        they sat on a giant rug and broke off the appendages of frozen buttermelons.  The shell
        was solid, but once it cracked, rich fruit cream was in abundance.  Sweet to taste and
        a very pleasant scent.


        "First film, you've got to see," said the goat.  "Locally filmed and produced.  I'm
        good friends with the lady who did casting.  Dated her for awhile.  Knew everyone
        who was going to play the different roles long before it was announced."


        The goat set the projector by Dr. Cham.  "I've got the music on the surround sound.
        You can man the knob."


        !i/filmstrip-1.gif(The Originals and their lonesome planet.)!


        Dr. Cham's mind wandered at this point in the presentation, just as the land war
        mounted between the two throngs of animal settlers.  The details of their wars
        and campaigns continued to consume the spool of transparent film that Dr. Cham
        was feeding through the projector.  


        War after war after war.  The Sieging of Elmer Lake.  The Last Stand of Newton P. Giraffe
        and Sons.  Dog Invasion of Little Abandoned Cloud.  No animals died in 
        these wars.  Most often an attack consisted of bopping another
        animal on the head.  And they philipped each other's noses.  But, believe me,
        it was humiliating.


        Blasted crying shame.  Things could have worked out.


        h3. The Birth of an Object


        "Don't worry," said the goat, anxious to sway Dr. Cham's attention back to the film.  "Things _do_
        work out."


        In Ruby, the Object is the very center of all things.  It is The Original.


        <pre>
         class ToastyBear < Object; end
        </pre>


        The angle bracket indicates *inheritance*.  This means that the new @ToastyBear@ class
        is a new class based on the @Object@ class.  Every method that @Object@ has will be
        available in @ToastyBear@.  Constants available in @Object@ will be available in
        @ToastyBear@.


        But every object inherits from @Object@.  The code...


        <pre>
         class ToastyBear; end
        </pre>


        Is identical to...


        <pre>
         class ToastyBear < Object; end
        </pre>


        Inheritance is handy.  You can create species of objects which relate to each other.
        Often, when you're dissecting a problem, you'll come across various objects which share
        attributes.  You can save yourself work by inheriting from classes which already solve
        part of that problem.


        You may have a @UnitedStatesAddress@ class which stores the address, city, state,
        and zip code for someone living in the United States.  When you start storing
        addresses from England, you could add a @UnitedKingdomAddress@ class.  If you then
        ensure that both addresses inherit from a parent @Address@ class, you can design
        your mailing software to accept any kind of address.


        <pre>
         def mail_them_a_kit( address )
           unless address.is_a? Address
             raise ArgumentError, "No Address object found."
           end
           print address.formatted
         end
        </pre>
 

        Also, inheritance is great if you want to override certain behaviours in a class.
        For example, perhaps you want to make your own slight variation to the @Array@ class.
        You want to enhance the @join@ method.  But if you change @Array#join@ directly, you
        will affect other classes in Ruby that use Arrays.


        So you start your own class called @ArrayMine@, which is based on The Original
        @Array@.
        

        <pre>
         class ArrayMine < Array
           # Build a string from this array, formatting each entry
           # then joining them together.
           def join( sep = $,, format = "%s" )
             collect do |item|
               sprintf( format, item )
             end.join( sep )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        @ArrayMine@ is now a custom @Array@ class with its own @join@ method.  @Array@ is
        the *superclass* of @ArrayMine@.  Every object has a @superclass@ method where you
        can verify this relationship.


        <pre>
         irb> ArrayMine.superclass
           => Array
        </pre>


        Perfect.  We manage a hotel and we have an @Array@ of our room sizes: @[3, 4, 6]@.
        Let's get it nicely printed for a brochure.


        <pre>
         rooms = ArrayMine[3, 4, 6]
         print "We have " + rooms.join( ", ", "%d bed" ) + " rooms available."
        </pre>


        Which prints, "We have 3 bed, 4 bed, 6 bed rooms available."


        Dr. Cham was looking around for a bathroom, but archival video tape was everywhere.
        He eventually found a place, it may have been a bathroom.  It had a metal bin.
        More importantly, it was dark and out of eyesight.
        

        While he's in there, let me add that while The Originals slaughtered The Invaders
        to prove their rights as First Creatures, the Ruby Object doesn't have any such
        dispute.  It is the absolute king Object the First.


        Watch.


        <pre>
         irb> Class.superclass
           => Module
         irb> Kernel.class
           => Module
         irb> Module.superclass
           => Object
         irb> Object.superclass
           => nil
        </pre>


        Even @Class@ is an @Object@!  See, although classes are the definition language for objects,
        we still call class methods on them and treat them like objects occassionally.  It may seem
        like a dizzying circle, but it's truly a very strict parentage.  And it ensures that when you
        alter the @Object@, you alter *everything in Ruby*.  Which is impossibly scary and all-powerful
        and cataclysmic and awesome!  *Ruby does not restrict you, my sister, my brother!* 


        Between @Class@ and @Object@, do you see @Module@?  If @Object@ is the king, the one who has
        sired every other part of Ruby, then @Module@ is the poor waifish nun, shielding
        and protecting all her little Ruby townspeople children.  (To complete the analogy:
        @Class@ is the village school teacher and @Kernel@ is the self-important colonel.)


        The whole point of @Module@'s existence is to give food and shelter to code.  Methods
        can stay dry under @Module@'s shawl.  @Module@ can hold classes and constants and 
        variables of any kind.


        "But what does a Module _do_?" you ask.  "How is it gainfully employed??"


        "That's all it does!!" I retort, stretching out my open palms in the greatest expression
        of futility known to man.  "Now hear me -- for I will never speak it again -- that Module Mother
        Superior has given these wretched objects a place to stay!!"


        <pre>
         # See, here is the module -- where else could our code possibly stay?
         module WatchfulSaintAgnes

           # A CONSTANT is laying here by the doorway.  Fine.
           TOOTHLESS_MAN_WITH_FORK = ['man', 'fork', 'exposed gums']

           # A Class is eating, living well in the kitchen.
           class FatWaxyChild; end

           # A Method is hiding back in the banana closet, God knows why.
           def timid_foxfaced_girl; {'please' => 'i want an acorn please'}; end

         end
        </pre>
           
           
        Now you have to go through Saint Agnes to find them.


        <pre>
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes::TOOTHLESS_MAN_WITH_FORK
         => ["man", "fork", "exposed gums"]
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes::FatWaxyChild.new
         => #<WatchfulSaintAgnes::FatWaxyChild:0xb7d2ad78>
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes::instance_methods
         => ["timid_foxfaced_girl"]
        </pre>


        Always remember that a @Module@ is only an inn.  A roof over their heads.  It is not
        a self-aware @Class@ and, therefore, cannot be brought to life with @new@.


        <pre>
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes.new
         NoMethodError: undefined method `new' for WatchfulSaintAgnes:Module
                 from (irb):2
        </pre>


        St. Agnes has given up her whole life in order that she may care for these desperate bits of code.
        Please.  Don't take that away from her.


        If you wanted to steal from St. Agnes, though, I can help you.
        You can bring in a larger abbey to swallow up the ministry of @WatchfulSaintAgnes@ and then
        what is she left with?


        For this you can use @extend@, which will pull all the methods from a module into a class or an object.


        <pre>
         >> class TheTimeWarnerAolCitibankCaringAndLovingFacility; end
         >> TheTimeWarnerAolCitibankCaringAndLovingFacility.extend WatchfulSaintAgnes
         >> TheTimeWarnerAolCitibankCaringAndLovingFacility::instance_methods
         => ["timid_foxfaced_girl"]
        </pre>


        In truth, no one's _stolen_ from @WatchfulSaintAgnes@, only borrowed.  The @timid_foxfaced_girl@
        now has two addresses.


        You gotta admit.  The old abbey can get bought out a zillion times and that little fox-faced
        girl will _still_ be back in the banana closet wanting an acorn!  Too bad we can't feed her.
        She's a method with no arguments.


        When Dr. Cham came out refreshed, the filmstrip was a bit behind.  But the goat hadn't
        noticed, so the Doctor advanced frames until it made some sense.


        !i/filmstrip-2.gif(The goats that told a planet it was ugly.)!


        So the invaders left the planet.


        "This planet _is_ decrepit," said Dr. Cham.  "The castle is nice.  But inside
        it's a disaster."


        "The whole castle look is a projection," said the goat.  "All the flowers
        and apple blossoms and the sky even.  It's a low-resolution projection."


        "Yes?  It is enchanting."


        "I guess."


        !i/filmstrip-3.gif(The spool ends.)!


        "That's messed up!" said the goat.  "That's not the way the film ends!
        There's no blood!  What happened?  What happened?  Did you screw up the knob, idiot?"


        "Well, I don't know," said Dr. Cham.  He turned the knob reverse and forward.
        Tapped the lens.


        "Check the film!  Check the film!"


        Dr. Cham pulled out a length of film from the projection feed, melted and dripping
        from its end.


        "Curse that!  These projectors are quality!  I've never had this happen.  There's
        no way."


        h3. Hunting For a Voice


        "I don't think it was the projector," said Dr. Cham.  "Something flew across that screen
        and uttered a blistering moan."


        "I don't have any dupes of that movie," said the goat somberly.  "And that girl.  That casting
        director.  I never see her anymore."


        Dr. Cham stood up and looked over the dumpy aisles of magnetic carnage, searching.


        "Oh, hey, you should call that girl," the goat went on. "You could talk to her, get an understanding.
        Tell her about me.  Don't act like your my friend, just, you know, 'Oh, that guy?
        Yeah, whatta maroon.'"


        Dr. Cham spotted the doorway and exited.


        The hallways were an entirely new world of mess.  In the goat's archives, the shelves had been messy.
        In the hallway, shelves were completely tipped.  Sinks were falling through the ceiling.  
        The Doctor ventured under the debris, kicking through plywood when necessary.


        "You shouldn't be out here," said the goat.  "You're on someone else's property at this point.
        A couple of pygmy elephants own all this.  They're nasty guys.  They'll beat the crap outta you
        with their trunks.  They ball it up and just whack ya."


        Dr. Cham pushed a file cabinet out of his way, which fell through a flimsy wall, then through
        the floor of the next room over.  And they heard it fall through several floors after that.


        "I'm trying to remember how it goes in the book," said Dr. Cham, as he walked swiftly through
        the hall.  "That milky fog that swept
        across the projection.  We find that thing."  He jiggled a door handle, broke it off.  Forged
        through the doorway and disappeared inside.


        "You really get a kick out of beating stuff up, don't you?" said the goat.  "Walls, doors."
        The goat headbutted a wall.  The wall shuddered and then laid still.


        Then, it was quiet.  And black.


        The goat stayed put in the bleak hallway, expecting Dr. Cham to flip over a few desks and emerge,
        ready to move on from the room he'd busted into.  But Dr. Cham didn't return, and the goat opted
        to share a moment with the neglected wreckage left by his neighbors.  Not that he could see at all.
        He could only hear the occassional rustling of the piles of invoices and carbon copy masters and
        manila envelopes when he shifted his legs.


        The ground seemed to buckling right under the goat, as if the heaps of kipple around him were
        beginning to slide toward his weight.  He would be at the center of this whirlpool of elephant
        documentation.  Would he die of papercuts first?  Or would he suffocate under the solid burial
        by office supplies?


        A soft light, however, crept up to him.  A floating, silver fish.  No, it was a -- was it scissors?
        The scissors grew into a shimmering cluster of intellegent bread, each slice choking on glitter.
        But, no, it was hands.  And an Easter hat.


        !i/hannah-1.gif(The goat alone in the hallway, meets an apparition.)!


        In another room, Dr. Cham stood under the clear glass silently.  The ceiling had abruptly
        gone transparent, then starlight washed over his pants and jacket.  He walked further to
        the room's center in muted colors, lit as softly as an ancient manuscript in its own box at
        the museum.  More stars, more cotton clusters of fire, unveiled as he came across the floor.
        And it peeked into view soon enough, he expected it to be larger, but it wasn't.


        Earth.  Like a painted egg, still fresh.  He felt long cello strings sing right up
        against his spine.  How could that be called Peoplemud?  Here was a vibrant and grassy
        lightbulb.  The one big ball that had something going for it.


        He thought of The Rockettes.  Actually, he missed The Rockettes.  What a bunch of
        great dancers.  He had yelled something to The Rockettes when he saw them.  Something
        very observant and flattering.


        Oh, yes, while The Rockettes were spinning, arm in arm, he had yelled, "Concentric circles!"
        Which no one else cared to observe. 
        

        And this thought was enough to feed Dr. Cham's superiority complex.  He wore a goofy
        smile as he retraced his footsteps.  He truthfully felt his genius coming through in
        such a statement.  To realize the simplicity of a circle was his.  He reflected on it
        all the way back to the hallway.


        Which I think is great.  Adore yourself when you have a second.

 
        !i/hannah-2.gif(The Doctor knows this ghost.)!


        "Oh, right," said the goat.  "Your niece.  The niece you killed.  I'm with ya now."


        For just a few moments, they all looked at each other.  Just enough
        time for both Dr. Cham and the goat to think: _Oh, yeah.  Hannah
        causes us a lot of trouble.  She's already talking about maple donuts._


        "Does she start talking about maple donuts right away like that?"
        asked the goat.


        "Yes, she does," said the Doctor.  "She brings it up to you, then
        she brings it up to me.  She sees a maple donut somewhere -- I don't
        quite remember where."


        "Do I see a real maple donut?" Hannah said.  "I need a real one."


        "Okay, okay," said the goat.  "Yeah, I remember: here's where she says
        that if she gets a real maple donut, she'll become a real person again.
        Because her real destiny was to own a bakery and you ruined that destiny
        and now she's trapped as a ghost."


        "Hey, that's the truth!" Hannah yelped.


        "It's terrible that we must bear through this whole scene again," said
        the Doctor.  "The donuts are immaterial.  They should be left out altogether."


        "Man, I am having a _hard_ time remembering all of this chapter," said
        the goat.  "I don't even remember how to get out of this hallway.  I must
        have read that book like thirty times.  Do we blast through a wall?   Do
        we scream until someone finds us?"


        "We get Hannah to float through walls and she finds some kind of machine,"
        says Dr. Cham.  "I have to write a program -- it all works out somehow."


        "But, you know what I'm saying?" said the goat.  "I forget all the details.
        Especially the earlier chapters.  I mean I can remember the ending perfectly.
        It's hard to sit through all this.  The end is so much better."


        Dr. Cham folded his arms and teetered on a heel.  "The porcupine."  He
        smiled greedily at the goat.


        "Oh, totally.  The porcupine is definitely who I want to meet," said the
        goat.  "I wonder what he does with all that money when the book is over."


        Dr. Cham nodded respectfully.  "I'm very excited to see him wearing slippers."


        "Those infernal slippers!" said the goat and he haw-hawed coarsely, a shower
        of saliva cascading from his jaws.


        Hannah's mind rattled, waiting for this nonsense to break for a moment.
        She tipped her head on its side and the rattle slid along the curve of
        her cranium.  The little noise died away, though, as the back of her head
        vanished (_fluxed out_ is what she called it) and then her head was  
        back again with its little rattle and she caught herself doing that
        careless moaning again.  *HRRRRRR-RRR-OH-RRRR-RRRR.*


        "I'm not as into the chunky bacon stuff," said the goat.  "I don't see
        what's so great about it."


        Could she speak while moaning? *BON-BON.*  With a French moan.  *BOHN-BOHN.
        BOHN-APPE-TEET-OHHHH-RRRR.*


        "I know she's harmless, but that sound freaks me out.  My hair is
        *completely* on end."


        "Hannah?" said Dr. Cham.  "Where are you, child?  Come do a good turn
        for us, my niece."


        She was right near them, in and out.  And they could hear her
        cleaning up her voice, bright, speaking like a angel scattering stardust.
        Yes, the whole maple donut story came out again, and more about the
        bakery she would own, the muffins and rolls and baguettes.
