    - Them What Live the Dream: >

        While The Originals' craft had long disappeared, Dr. Cham frantically worked away at the
        computer built into the control panel up in the observation deck.  Hannah had disappeared
        into the floor (or perhaps those little sparks along the ground were still wisps of her
        paranormal presence!) and the goat amicably watched Dr. Cham hack out a Ruby module.


        <pre>
         require 'endertromb'
         module WishScanner
           def scan_for_a_wish
             wish = self.read.detect do |thought|
               thought.index( 'wish: ' ) == 0
             end
             wish.gsub( 'wish: ', '' )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        "What's your plan?" asked the goat.  "It seems like I could have solved this problem in
        like three lines."


        "This @Module@ is the new @WishScanner@ technology," he said.  "The scanner only picks up
        a wish if it starts with the word @wish@ and a colon and a space.  That way the planet doesn't
        fill up with every less-than-ten-letter word that appears in people's heads."


        "Why don't you just use a class?" asked the goat.


        "Because a @Module@ is simpler than a class.  It's basically just a storage facility
        for methods.  It keeps a group of methods together.  You can't create new objects
        from a method."


        "But aren't you going to want a @WishScanner@ object, so you can actually use
        it?" said the goat, appalled.


        "I'm going to mix it into the @MindReader@," said Dr. Cham.  And he did.


        <pre>
         require 'mindreader'
         class MindReader
           include MindScanner
         end
        </pre>


        "Now, the @MindScanner@ module is mixed in to the @MindReader@," said Dr. Cham.
        "I can call the @scan_for_a_wish@ method on any @MindReader@ object."


        "So, it's a mixin," said the goat.  "The @MindScanner@ mixin."


        "Yes, any module which is introduced into a class with @include@ is a mixin to that
        class.  If you go back and look at the @scan_for_a_wish@ method, you'll see that it
        calls a @self.read@ method.  I just have to make sure that whatever class I'm mixing
        @MindScanner@ into has a @read@ method.  Otherwise, an error will be thrown."


        "That seems really wierd that the mixin requires certain methods that it doesn't already have.
        It seems like it should work by itself."


        Dr. Cham looked up from the keyboard at the goat.  "Well, it's sort of like your video collection.
        None of your video cassettes work unless they are put in a machine that uses video cassettes.
        The depend on each other.  A mixin has some basic requirements, but once a class meets those
        requirements, you can add all this extra functionality in."


        "Hey, that's cool," said the goat.


        "You read the book thirty times and you didn't pick that up?" asked Dr. Cham.


        "You're a much better teacher in person," said the goat.  "I really didn't think I was going
        to like you very much."


        "I completely understand," said the Doctor.  "This is much more real than the cartoons
        make it seem."


        <pre>
         require 'wishmaker'
         reader = MindReader.new
         wisher = WishMaker.new
         loop do
           wish = reader.scan_for_a_wish
           if wish
             wisher.grant( wish )
           end
         end
        </pre>



        Irb sat and looped on the screen.  It'll do that until you hit Control-C.  But Dr. Cham let it
        churn away.  Looping endlessly, scanning the mind waves for a proper wish.


        And Dr. Cham readied his wish.  At first, he thought immediately of a @stallion@.  To ride bareback
        over the vales of Sedna.  But he pulled the thought back, his wish hadn't been formed properly.
        A stallion was useless in pursuing The Originals, so he closed his eyes again, bit his lip
        and he thought to himself: @wish: whale@.


        h3. Last Whale to Peoplemud


        The blocky, sullen whale appeared down at the castle entrance, where Hannah was
        bashing on a rosebud with her hand.  She whacked at it with a fist, but it only stayed
        perfect and pleasant and crisp against the solid blue sky of Endertromb.


        "I'm bored," she said to the whale.  *BOHR-BOHR-OHRRRRRR.*


        "Ok," said the whale, deep and soft.  As the word slid along his massive tongue, its
        edges chipped off and the word slid out polished and worn in a bubble by his mouth's
        corner.


        "I always have to die," said the young ghost.  "People always kill me."


        The whale fluttered his short fins, which hung at useless distance from the ground.
        So, he pushed himself toward her with his tail.  Scooting over patches of grass.


        "People kill, so who do they kill?" said the girl.  "Me.  They kill me every time."


        The whale made it to within three meters of the girl, where he towered like a
        great war monument that represents enough dead soldiers to actually steal a lumbering step
        towards you.  And now, the whale rested his tail and, exhausted by the climb thus far,
        let his eyelids fall shut and became a gently puffing clay mountain, his shadow
        rich and doubled-up all around the hardly visible Hannah.


        But another shadow combined, narrow and determined.  Right behind her, the hand came
        on to her shoulder, and the warm ghost inside the hand touched her sleeve.


        "How did you get down here?" said the girl.


        Dr. Cham sat right alongside her and the goat walked around and stood in front.


        "Listen to us," said Dr. Cham.  "We've got to follow this mangy pack of ne'er-do-wells
        to the very end, Hannah.  And to nab them, we need your faithful assistance!"


        "I'm scared," cried Hannah.


        "You're not scared," said the goat.  "Come on.  You're a terrifying little phantom child."


        "Well," she said.  "I'm a little bored."


        Dr. Cham bent down on a knee, bringing his shaggy presence toward the ground, his face
        just inches from hers.  "If you come with us, if you can trust what we know, then we can bag
        this foul troupe.  Now, you say your destiny is to be a baker.  I won't dispute that.
        You have every right on Earth -- and Endertromb, for that matter -- to become a baker.
        Say, if you didn't become a baker, that would be a great tragedy.  Who's going to take
        care of all those donuts if you don't?" 


        She shrugged.  "That's what I've been saying."


        "You're right," said the Doctor.  "You've been saying it from the start."  He looked up to
        the sky, where the wind whistled peacefully despite its forceful piercing by The Originals'
        rocketship.  "If your destiny is to be a baker, then mine is to stop all this, to end the
        mayhem that is just beginning to boil.  And hear me, child -- hear how sure and solid my voice
        becomes when I say this -- I ended your life, I bear sole responsibility for your life as
        an apparition, but I will get it back.  It's going to take more than a donut, but you will
        have a real childhood.  I promise you."

        Sure, it took a minute for the goat to cut his wish down to ten letters, but he was shortly on
        his way, following the same jetstreams up into the sky, up toward Dr. Cham and his ghost
        niece Hannah.  Up toward the villanous animal combo pak called The Originals.  Up toward
        The Rockettes.


        And Digger Dosh bludgeoned and feasted on each second they left behind them.
