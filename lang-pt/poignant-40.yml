      Pensando em você.  E em seu bem-estar.: >

        Eu preciso que você esteja num bom estado mental para o resto do livro.
        Agora é hora de começar a te condicionar.


        Vamos começar respirando profundamente.  Inspire profundamente
        e conte até quatro comigo.


        Vamos lá.  1.  2.  3.  4.   Agora expire.  Você pode
        sentir seus olhos.  Bom, é isso mesmo.


        Agora vamos inspirar profundamente e, na sua mente, desenhe um hipopótamo
        o mais rápido que puder.  Rápido rápido.  Suas pernas, sua forma, seus dentes
        de marshmallow.  Ok, feito.  Agora expire.


        Dê mais uma boa inspirada e segure.  As you hold it tightly in
        your chest, imagine the tightness is shrinking you down into a bug.
        You've held your breath so hard that you're an insect.  And all the
        other bugs saw you shrink and they loved the stunt.  They're clapping
        and rubbing their feelers together madly.   But you had an apple in
        your hand when you were big and it just caught up with you, crushed
        the whole crowd.  You're dead, too.  Now exhale.


        Give me a solid deep breath and imagine you live in a town where
        everything is made of telephone cords.  The houses are all telephone
        cords, the shingles, the rafters.  The doorways are a thick mass of
        telephone cords which you simply thrust yourself through.  When you
        go to bed, the bedspread is telephone cords.  And the mattress and
        box springs are telephone cords, too.  Like I said, everything is made
        out of telephone cords.  The telephone itself is made of telephone
        cords.  But the telephone cord going to the telephone is made out of
        bread and a couple sticks.  Now exhale.


        Inspire.  1.  2.  3.  4.  Expire.


        Inspire.  1.  2.  Inspire mais um pouco.  3.  4.  Imagine suas mãos
        saindo dos pulsos, voando atá a tela do computador
        e programando ele de dentro.  Expire.


        Big, big deep breath.  Deep down inside you there is a submarine.
        It has a tongue.  Exhale.


        Respire pelo nariz.  Deep breath.  Filtre o ar pelo 
        seu nariz.  Respirar pelo nariz te dá ar de qualidade.
        Your nostrils flare, you are taking breaths of nature's air, the way
        God intended.  Imagine a floppy disk drive clogged up with orphans.
        And while it chokes on orphans, you have good, wholesome God's 
        breath in your lungs.  But that pleasurable, life-giving air will
        become a powerful toxin if held too long.  _Hurry, exhale God and
        nature's air!_


        Now, you will wake up, smoothing out the creases of this page in
        your web browser.  You will have full recollection of your
        whole life and not forgetting any one of the many 
        adventures you have had in your life.  You
        will feel rich and renewed and expert.  You will have no remembrance
        of this short exercise, you will instead remember teaching a rabbit
        to use scissors from a great distance.


        And as you will wake up with your eyes directed to the top of this
        exercise, you will begin again.  But this time, try to imagine that
        even _your shadow_ is a telephone cord.
