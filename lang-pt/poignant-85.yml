      Windows Hiccups: >      

        Okay, here's what you do to get tab completion working in Windows.  
        "Download this.":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/dist/readline.so-for-1.8.zip
        A zip with two files inside.  These get copied into your Ruby installation.
        Place readline.dll in the *bin* folder.  The readline.so goes in
        *lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32* folder.


        Then, run in your command shell: @irb --readline -r irb/completion@.


        And for Europeans, you'll need "this.":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/dist/Input.euro
        Save it as *.inputrc* and place it in your home directory.  (Your personal directory
        which contains your Desktop and My Documents folders.)
