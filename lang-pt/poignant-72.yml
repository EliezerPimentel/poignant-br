    - Walking, Walking, Walking, Walking and So Forth: >

        The evening grew dark around the pair of foxes.  They had wound their way through
        alleys packed with singing possums, and streets where giraffes in rumpled sportscoats
        bumped past them with their briefcases.  They kept walking.  


        And now the stores rolled shut their corrugated metal lids.  
        Crickets crawled out from the gutters and nudged at the loose change.


        !i/wixl-6.gif(Why such hard feelings?)!


        "Anyway, you must admit he's a terrible President," said Fox Small. _"Why_ does President Marcos have a rabbit as Vice President of
        the Foxes."


        "The Vice President?  The rabbit with the _eyebrows_?"


        "No, the rabbit with the *huge sausage lips*," said Fox Small.


        But their conversation was abruptly interupted by a freckly cat head which popped from the sky just above the sidewalk.


        !i/wixl.blix-1.gif(At least they're still in the book...)!


        What is this about?!


        !i/wixl-14.gif(Will the book finish?)!


        Oh, come on.  This is rich.  More meta.


        I'm not going to bother illustrating this discussion Blixy had with the foxes at this point!
        It's all a *bunch of _conjecture_*.  _HOW_ can they presume to know the landscape of my family drama?
        I love my sister.  For a long time, I _worshipped_ her. (This is my sister Quil.)


        I admit that there was a pretty painful day a few months ago and I kind of freaked out.  I was
        laid out on the long patio chair by the pool in my mom's backyard.  I had a Dr. Pepper and a bit
        of german chocolate cake.  I was eating with a kid fork.  Everything else was in the dishwasher,
        that's all they had.  Three prongs.


        My mom started talking about Quil.  All about how much money she was blowing on pants and purses.
        A five-hundred dollar purse.  And then she said, "She's losing it.
        She sounded totally high on the phone." (She nailed it on the head, Quil was smoking dope and
        loving it.)


        So I'd been noticing how observant my mom could be.  That's why, when she said, "I actually think she's on
        cocaine," I _physically_ stood up and chucked my soda across the yard.


        It sailed off into the woods somewhere.  We had been talking awhile, so it was dark when the can flew.
        I paced a bit.  And then I screamed at the top of my lungs.


        My uncle Mike was standing there with the glass door open, staring at me.  He said something totally
        nervous like, "Oh, okay.  Well, I'll--"  And the tea in his glass was swishing back and forth, sloshing
        all over.  He disappeared.  He's not very good at saying things to people.  He's more of a whistler.  And resonant.


        !i/wixl.blix-2.gif(Moving along.)!


        So, to be completely honest, yes, I got a little mad.  I got mad.  You know.  I dealt with it.
        Quil calls me regularly.  For some stupid reason, I rarely call her.


        Plus, she didn't end up killing herself.  So it's just not an issue.  Who knows if it was real.
        She just had a lot of vodka.  And she's little.  So it was just scary to see Quil guzzling it down like that.
        I mean forcing it down.
 

        But why talk about it?  It'll just make her feel like I'm disappointed.  Or like I'm a jerk.


        Well, I got off track there a bit.  Where was I?  Blix is basically helping the foxes around, getting them on
        the trail of their truck.  Yeah, back to all that.


        !i/wixl-3.gif(Frogs who save seats on the bus.)!


        "We can't squeeze on to this bus," said the smallest fox.


        "Guys, walk on up," said Blix.  "What's the hold up?  Oh, the frogs.  Yeah, just squeeze through."
        Blixy pushed from behind.


        "Hey," said the Tall Fox.  "I'm crammed on this little step!  Somebody move!"


        "Did you get through-- young fox??" said the cat.


        "No," said Fox Small, "can't you see?  The driver keeps shaking his head and it's _really_
        making me nervous.  I don't think he wants us on."


        "Go," said Blix.  He stepped down from his step and walked around the bus, peering through
        the plexiglass windows.  "Well, I don't know, guys.  I dunno.  I guess it's got a lot of frogs."  He pounded
        on the window.  "Hey!  Move over!"


        And that's the reality of riding intercity transit in Wixl.  It's terribly competitive.  The morning
        bus is so crowded that most white collar animals get frogs to hold their seat through the nighttime.
        For whatever reason, it works.  It's become this staple of their workflow and their economy.


        If you can muster up a bit of imagination, you can see a *percent sign* as a frog's slanted face.
        Got the picture in your head?  Now let me show you frogs that camp out inside strings.


        <pre>
         # The %s format is for placing full strings.
         irb> "Seats are taken by %s and %s." % ['a frog', 'a frog with teeth']
           => "Seats are taken by a frog and a frog with teeth."

         # The %d format is for placing numbers, while the %f format is for
         # floats (decimal numbers).
         irb> frogs = [44, 162.30]
         irb> stats = "Frogs have filled %d seats and paid %f blue crystals."
         irb> stats % frogs
           => "Frogs have filled 44 seats and paid 162.30 blue crystals."

         # Formatting is flexible with types, you can pass in strings
         # and format them like numbers.
         irb> frogs = ['44', '162.30']
         irb> stats % frogs
           => "Frogs have filled 44 seats and paid 162.30 blue crystals."
        </pre>


        What you are seeing above uses the @%@ method in the @String@ class.
        This method takes *a string* and *an array* and slurps them in together
        to create a new string.  The items from the list are yanked out (in order) and
        placed in their saved seats.  It's the open of the business
        day and the frogs have done their job.


        <pre>
         # See, here's the String#% method called like other methods.
         irb> "Please move over, %s.".%( 'toothless frog' )
           => "Please move over, toothless frog"

         # Now let's call it the prettier way, with the percent sign
         # right between the string and the array.
         irb> "Here is your 1098 statement for the year, %s." % ['teeth frog']
           => "Here is your 1098 statement for the year, teeth frog."
        </pre>


        This is also available as the @Kernel::format@ method or @Kernel::sprintf@
        method.  (In the C language, there is a @sprintf@ method which operates
        just like this.)


        <pre>
         irb> format "Frogs are piled %d deep and travel at %d mph.", [5, 56]
           => "Frogs are piled 5 deep and travel at 56 mph."
        </pre>


        For the most part, you'll only need @%s@ (strings), @%d@ (integer numbers)
        or @%f@ (float numbers) format specifiers.  The @%p@ placeholder will
        run @inspect@ on an object.


        Yeah, so, frog formatting is really handy for building strings that are
        assembled from different kinds of data.  You can learn all the various
        kinds of format specifiers by reading the @ri sprintf@ page.  I'm just
        going to give you a few quick pointers.


        Let's say you have the array but you want the items to appear in
        *a different order* in the string.  In such a situation, you can identify
        specific items by placing a number (@1$@ for the first item, @2$@ for the second,
        and so on) right after the percent sign.


        <pre>
         irb> "This bus has %1$d more stops before %2$d o'clock.  That's %1$d more stops." % [16, 8]
           => "This bus has 16 more stops before 8 o'clock.  That's 16 more stops."
        </pre>


        The second tip I have for you is that you can allot a certain number of characters for
        each item, a width.  And if an item is smaller than the width, extra spaces
        will be used before the item.  To pad it.
        If the width is a negative number, the item will be forced to left and the
        padding will come after it.


        <pre>
         # Give one item 30 characters of width
         irb> "In the back of the bus: %30s." % ['frogs']
           => "In the back of the bus:                          frogs."

         # Give one left-justified item 30 characters of width
         irb> "At the front of the bus: %-30s." % ['frogs']
           => "At the front of the bus: frogs                         ."
        </pre>


        Fox Small kept looking up at the bus driver.  Remember, he wouldn't enter the bus!


        "What's the deal?" said Fox Tall.  "Can't you just get on and we'll just stand in the aisle?"


        "You really want to get on this bus?  That driver has no hands," said Fox Small, speaking close
        and hushed to Fox Tall, "and all he has, instead of hands, are sucker cups."
