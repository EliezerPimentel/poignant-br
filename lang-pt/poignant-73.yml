      More From The Chilling Ongoing Preview of The Scarf Eaters: >

        (_from Chapter XII: Thank Heaven for Little Men_.)


        "Close the door," Spencer repeated, but Lara's hand trembled and she fumbled sloppily at the latch.
        Her dad hadn't taught her to close doors like this one.


        "Yes, it's an unusual door," said Brent.  He walked over and closed the door for her.
        Then, he held her hand and looked into her eyes.  His eyes lit up like huge matchsticks
        that would be too huge to be practical.  "It's an unusual handle, which ensures that
        those who don't eat scarves stay out."


        "Sit down, everyone," Spencer demanded, as he bounded across the room and took command.
        "I command this organization," he stated.  "The secret organization of The Scarf Eaters!"


        The torches encircling the room blazed like invincibly huge matches and the handful of
        teenagers sat.  Except for Spencer who stood high and mighty, drawing all the oxygen
        in the entire room into his nostrils before speaking.


        "One of us," he said, dramatically and invincibly, "is missing!"


        The entire room gasped, which also used oxygen.  The room was abuzz.  "Who?"  "How?"
        "Who was it?"  Nobody knew.  Except for Spencer, who lept across the room and took charge.


        "Our dear friend Steve Bridell has been stolen from us," announced Spencer in a deafeningly
        loud voice, as if thousands of giant matchsticks were struck against a brittle surface in
        unison amidst a pile of oxygen.  "Steve Bridell.  Do any of you know Steve Bridell?"


        The hall was silent.


        Spencer continued.  "Steve Bridell was an incredible resource and you all knew him
        and loved him.  He carved this enormous wooden man we use as our podium."  Spencer pointed.
        "He also made the set of wooden cymbals that are back in our instrument closet right now."


        Some of the audience stood.


        "Wait," instructed Spencer.  "Don't go back there.   I've already checked.  The cymbals are
        gone!"
