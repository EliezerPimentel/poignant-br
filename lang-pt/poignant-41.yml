        h3. But Was He Sick??


        You know, he had such bad timing.  He was scattered as a novelist, but his ventures into alchemy
        were very promising.  He had an elixir of goat's milk and sea salt that got rid of leg aches.
        One guy even grew an inch on a thumb he'd lost.  He had an organic health smoke that smelled like
        foot but gave you night vision.  He was working on something called Liquid Ladder, but I've never
        seen or read anything else about it.  It can't have been for climbing.  Who knows.


        One local newspaper actually visited Dr. Cham.  Their book reviewer gave him four stars.
        Really.  She did an article on him.  Gave him a rating.


        Just know that Dr. N. Harold Cham felt terrible about his niece.  He felt the shock treatment
        would work.  The polio probably would have killed her anyway, but he took the chance.


        On Sept. 9, 1941, after sedating her with a dose of phenacetin in his private operating room, he attached
        the conducting clips to Hannah's nose, tongue, toes, and elbows.  Assisted by his apprentice, a bespeckled
        undergraduate named Marvin Holyoake, they sprinkled the girl with the flakes of a substance the doctor
        called _opus magnum_.  A white powder gold which would carry the current and blatantly energize the girl,
        forcing her blood to bloom and fight and vanquish.
        

        But how it failed, oh, and how, when the lever was tossed, she arched and kicked -- and 
        *KABLAM!* -- and *BLOY-OY-OY-KKPOY!*  Ringlets of hair and a wall of light, and the 
        bell of death rang.  The experiment collapsed in a dire plume of
        smoke and her innocence (_for weeks, everyone started out with, "And she will never
        have the chance..."_) was a great pit in the floor and in their lungs.


        To Hannah, I code.


        <pre>
         opus_magnum = true
         def save_hannah
           success = opus_magnum
         end
        </pre>


        A method is its own island.  And what goes on inside is unaffected by the simple variables around it.
        Dr. Cham couldn't breach the illness of his niece, no more than an @opus_magnum@ variable can penetrate
        the steely exterior of a method.


        Should we run the @save_hannah@ method, Ruby will squawk at us, claiming it sees no @opus_magnum@.


        I'm talking about *scope*.  Microscopes narrow and magnify your vision.  Telescopes extend the
        range of your vision.  In Ruby, *scope* refers to a field of vision inside methods and blocks.


        A method's @def@ statement opens its vision.  Variable names introduced there will be seen
        by the method and kept meaningful until its @end@ closes its eyes.  You can pass data into a
        method by using arguments and data can be returned from the method, but the names used inside
        the method are only good for its scope.


        Some variables have wider scope.  Global variables like @$LOAD_PATH@, which start with a *cash*
        symbol, are available in any scope.  Instance variables like @@names@, which start with an *at*
        are available anywhere inside a class scope.  Same goes for class variables like @@@tickets@.
        Class and instance variables will be explored in a moment.


        Blocks have scope, but it's a bit fuzzier.  More flexible.


        <pre>
         verb = 'rescued'
         ['sedated', 'sprinkled', 'electrocuted'].
         each do |verb|
           puts "Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
         end
         puts "Yes, Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
        </pre>


        The block _iterates_ (spins, cycles) through each of the Doctor's actions.  The @verb@ variable
        changes with each pass.  In one pass, he's sedating.  In the next, he's powdering.  Then, he's
        electrocuting.


        So, the question is: after the block's over, will he have rescued Hannah?


        <pre class="result">
         Dr. Cham sedated his niece Hannah.
         Dr. Cham sprinkled his niece Hannah.
         Dr. Cham electrocuted his niece Hannah.
         Yes, Dr. Cham electrocuted his niece Hannah.
        </pre>


        Blocks are allowed to see variables in the vicinity.  The block noticed that the @verb@ variable
        existed and it overwrote its contents as it went along.  When the block completed and its tiny life 
        ended, the @verb@ variable came out a changed creature.


        If a block uses a variable which hasn't been used previously, though, then that variable vanishes at the
        end of the block.  The block's *scope* closes and the variable goes with it.  Say that @verb@ wasn't used
        before the block.


        <pre>
         ['sedated', 'powdered', 'electrocuted'].
         each do |verb|
           puts "Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
         end
         puts "Yes, Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
        </pre>


        Pulls an error: @undefined local variable or method `verb'@.  Poof.


        It must be something difficult, even for a great scientist, to carry away the corpse of a young girl
        whose dress is still starched and embroidered, but whose mouth is darkly clotted purple at the corners.  
        In Dr. Cham's journal, he writes that he was tormented by her ghost, which glistened gold and scorched
        lace.  His delusions grew and he ran from hellhounds and massive vengeful, angelic hands.


        Only weeks later, he was gone, propelled from these regrets, vanishing in the explosion 
        that lifted him from the planet.


        And even as you are reading this now, sometime in these moments, the bell jar craft of our
        lone Dr. Cham touched down upon a distant planet after a sixty year burn.  
        As the new world came into view, as the curvature of the planet widened, 
        as the bell jar whisked through the upset heavens, tearing through sheets of aurora and
        solar wind, Dr. Cham's eyes were shaken open.


        !i/dr.cham-2.gif(Safe landing.  Amazement.)!


        What you are witnessing is the landing of Dr. Cham on the planet Endertromb.  From what I
        can gather, he landed during the cusp of the Desolate Season, a time when there really isn't
        much happening on the planet.  Most of the inhabitants find their minds locked into a listless
        hum which causes them to disintegrate into just vapid ghosts of one-part-wisdom and three-parts-steam
        for a time.


        My modest grasp of the history and climate of Endertromb has been assembled from hanging around
        my daughter's organ instructor, who grew up on the planet.


        !i/elderly-3.gif(Dead husbands could destroy the Doctor.)!


        I frequently drill my daughter's organ instructor in order to ensure that he can keep appointments
        adequately.  That he can take house calls at odd hours and promptly answer emergency calls.
        When he finally revealed to me that he was an alien whose waking day consisted of five-hundred
        and forty waking hours, I was incredibly elated and opened a contractual relationship with him
        which will last into 2060.

        
        For three days (by his pocket watch's account), Dr. Cham travelled the dark shafts of air,
        sucking the dusty wind of the barren planet.
        But on the third day, he found the Desolate Season ending and he awoke to a brilliant vista, 
        decorated with spontaneous apple blossoms and dewy castle tiers.
