    - Opening This Book: >
        Pretend that you've opened this book (although you probably _have_ opened this book),
        just to find a huge onion right in the middle crease of the book.  (The manufacturer of the book
        has included the onion at my request.)


        So you're like, "Wow, this book comes with an onion!"  (Even if you don't particularly like onions,
        I'm sure you can appreciate the logistics of shipping any sort of produce discreetly inside of an alleged
        programming manual.)


        Then you ask yourself, "Wait a minute.  I thought this was a book on Ruby, the incredible new
        programming language from Japan.  And although I can appreciate the logistics of shipping any sort of
        produce discreetly inside of an alleged programming manual: Why an onion? What am I supposed to do
        with it?"


        No.  Please don't puzzle over it.  You don't need to do anything with the onion.  Set the onion aside
        and let _it_ do something with _you_.


        I'll be straight with you.  I want you to cry.  To weep.  To whimper sweetly.  This book is a *poignant*
        guide to Ruby.  That means code so beautiful that tears are shed.  That means gallant tales and somber truths
        that have you waking up the next morning in the arms of this book.  Hugging it tightly to you all the day long.
        If necessary, fashion a makeshift hip holster for _Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby_, so you can always have this
        book's tender companionship.


        You really must sob once.  Or at least sniffle.  And if not, then the onion will make it all happen for you.
