    - The Leaf as a Status Symbol in Ambrose: >

        Alright, Elf.  Give us a quick rundown of the currency issues you've faced there in your kingdom.

        Yeah, that's not the way I remember it.  This Elf was paging me constantly.  When I refused to
        call him back, he somehow left a message on my pager.  Meaning: it beeped a couple times and
        then printed out a small slip of paper.  The slip said something to the effect of, "Get down here
        quick!" and also, "We've got to rid the earth of this scourge of enterpreneurial caterpillars,
        these twisted insect vikings are suffocating my blue crystals!"


        Lately, the exchange rate has settled down between leaves and crystals.  One treegrown note is
        worth five crystals.  So the basic money situation looks like this:


        <pre>
         blue_crystal = 1
         leaf_tender = 5
        </pre>


        This example is, like, _totally_ last chapter.  Still.  It's a start.  We're setting two _variables_.
        The *equals sign* is used for _assignment_.


        Now @leaf_tender@ represents the number @5@ (as in: five blue crystals.)  This concept right here is
        *half of Ruby*.  We're _defining_.  We're _creating_.  This is half of the work.  
        Assignment is the most basic form of defining.


        You can't complain though, can you Elf?  You've built an empire from cashing your blue crystals
        into the new free market among the forest creatures.  (And even though he's an elf to us, he's a
        tall monster to them.)
