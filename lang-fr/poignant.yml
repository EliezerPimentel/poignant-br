  - Lisez Ce Paragraphe: >
      Chez mon libraire, il y a un mur énorme de livres sur Java qui
      attendent juste de me tomber dessus et de m'écraser. A la
      vitesse où vont les choses, ce mur sera un jour si haut qu'il
      nous écrasera tous. Il pourra même faire plusieurs fois le tour
      de la terre, écrasant les éditions précédentes des mêmes livres
      sur Java, encore et encore.

  - Et Ce Paragraphe Aussi: >
      C'est juste un petit livre sur Ruby. Il ne vous écrasera pas. Il
      est aussi léger qu'une plume (car non encore terminé --
      ;) ). Et il y a une raison pour laquelle ce livre restera
      léger: car Ruby est simple à apprendre.

  - Kon'nichi wa, Ruby:
    - En ouvrant ce livre: >
        Supposons que vous ayez ouvert ce livre (bien que vous _ayez_
        probablement ouvert ce livre), et que vous trouviez un énorme
        oignon juste au milieu. (L'imprimeur du livre a inclus
        l'oignon à ma demande.)

 
        Donc, vous pensez, "Whoua, ce livre est livré avec un oignon !"
        (Même si vous n'aimez pas particulièrement les oignons, je
        suis sûr que vous êtes à même d'apprécier la logistique
        nécessaire à la livraison discrète de quelque produit que ce
        soit à l'intérieur d'un prétendu manuel de programmation.)


        Puis vous vous demandez, "Attend une minute. Je pensais que
        c'était un livre sur Ruby, l'incroyable nouveau langage de
        programmation en provenance du Japon. Et, bien que j'apprécie
        la logistique nécessaire à la livraison discrète de quelque
        produit que ce soit à l'intérieur d'un prétendu manuel de
        programmation, Pourquoi un oignon ? Que suis-je supposé faire
        avec ?"


        Non. S'il vous plait, ne vous posez pas de question. Vous ne
        devez rien faire avec cet oignon. Mettez l'oignon de côté et
        laissez _le_ faire quelque chose pour _vous_.


        Je serais direct avec vous. Je veux vous faire pleurer. Sangloter,
        larmoyer gentillement. Ce livre est un guide *poignant* vers
        Ruby. Ce qui veut dire un code si beau qu'il vous en tirera des
        larmes. Cela veut dire des contes galants et de sombres
        vérités qui feront que vous vous réveillerez le matin suivant
        dans les bras de ce livre. Le serrant étroitement contre vous
        toute la journée. Si nécessaire, fabriquez un étui pour le
        _Guide (Poignant) de Why vers Ruby_, afin de l'avoir toujours
        contre vous.


        Vous devriez vraiment sangloter une fois. Ou au moins
        renifler. Et sinon, l'oignon vous aidera.

      Ce que Je Vais Faire Avec les Gains Massifs Générés par ce Livre: >

        Tous ceux qui ont écrit un livre vous diront combien un auteur
        est facilement distrait par des visions de grandeurs. En ce
        qui me concerne, je m'arrête deux fois pour chaque paragraphe,
        et quatre fois pour chaque bande-dessinée, juste pour évaluer
        la fortune et la prospérité que ce livre me procurera. Aussi
        j'ai peur que l'écriture de ce livre ne s'arrête pour faire
        place à l'armada de SUV et de voitures de luxe qui brillent
        dans mon esprit.


        Plutôt que d'arrêter l'écriture du Guide (Poignant), j'ai
        réservé cet espace en tant que "zone de sécurité" afin de
        déverser mes voeux vains.


        Aujourd'hui j'étais dans un restaurant italien, Granado,et
        j'étais en train de payer ma note. J'ai alors remarqué une
        bouteille de vinaigre balsamique à 150 euros. Très petite. Je
        pouvais la faire tenir dans ma main. Âgée de 22 ans.


        J'ai passé beaucoup de temps à penser à cette bouteille. C'est
        souvent un accessoire de mes fantasmes obsessionnels.
        Dans un de ces fantasmes, je rentrais dans le restaurant, je
        retournais une pile de feuillage sur le comptoir, et demandais
        instamment au caissier: "Vite! J'ai une salade importante à faire!"


        Dans un autre fantasme du même acabit, je jette de la
        laitue. Cette saleté ne convient pas à mon nouveau
        vinaigre. Non, j'arriverai à un point où la célébrité et
        l'aristocratie m'auront corrompu au plus profond de mon
        être. Ma nouvelle laitue sera de l'argent. De l'argent froid
        et dur, Madame Price.


        Bientôt, je dépenserai des centaines d'euros pour un morceau
        de myzithra[1].


        Mes fantaisies sont toutefois allées plus loin que la
        possession. Certes, j'ai examiné par le détail mes
        acquisitions d'urnes grecques, de cortèges de voitures, de compagnies
        aériennes, de pyramides et d'os de
        dinosaures. De temps à autres, je verrai des villes secouées
        par le vent aux informations, et je rajouterai sur ma liste: _Ouragan_.
        

        Mais maintenant j'envisage un but plus large. Pour parler
        simplement: que va-t-il se passer si j'amasse une fortune
        telle que les Monnaies ne puisse pas imprimer assez pour
        soutenir ma demande? Tous les autres seraient obligés
        d'utiliser des billets de Monopoly. Et vous devriez gagner au
        Monopoly pour pouvoir manger. Ce serait des parties assez
        tendues. Je veux dire que vous devriez hypothéquer vos biens,
        et vos enfants commenceraient à pleurer. En plus, je pense que
        vous commenceriez à voir la fin de ceux qui choisissent les
        places libre de stationnement comme les "coffres
        alternatifs":http://monopolyste.online.fr/regles.shtml#freeparc
        pour les fonds de la ville.

        Vous aurez à vous en remettre à de l'argent factice
        toutefois. Le faux argent est le meilleur. Vous pouvez en
        avoir si facilement. Pendant un instant, c'est comme si vous
        étiez un riche fou. Quand j'étais enfant, nous avions
        construit avec des enfants du voisinage ce petit
        "Tijuana":http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana dans notre
        rue. Nous avions fabriqué nos propres pesos et portions des
        sombreros et tout le reste!


        Un des enfants vendait des
        "tamales":http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamales chauds pour
        deux pesos chacun. _Deux pesos!_ Est-ce qu'il savait que la
        monnaie était fausse ? A quoi pensait-il ? Qui a invité ce
        gosse? Savait-il que ce n'était pas vraiment Tijuana?
        Peut-être était-il vraiment de Tijuana! Peut-être que c'était
        de _vrais_ pesos!  Fabriquons plus de _vrais_ pesos!


        Je crois que nous avions même une taverne, ou vous pouviez
        vous saouler de Kool-Aid[2]. Il n'y a rien de tel qu'un groupe
        de gosses trébuchants, marmonnant de façon incohérente avec
        des lèvres rouges comme celles d'un clown.


        fn1. NDT: fromage grec.


        fn2. NDT: sorte de cristaux qui, une fois
             dilué dans l'eau donne une boisson aromatisée et sucrée.
        
    - L'Histoire du Chien: >

        OK, essayons ce premier morceau d'intensité:


        Un jour, alors que je marchais sur une de ces routes à grand trafic
        pleines de vendeurs de voitures (c'était peu après
        l'annulation de mon mariage), j'ai trouvé un chien
        abandonné sur la route. Un chien laineux, noir avec des yeux
        rouges verdâtres. Me sentant moi-même un peu abandonné,
        j'attrapais quelques ballons accrochés à un poteau devant une
        agence, et je les accrochais au collier du chien. Ensuite j'ai
        décidé qu'il serait mon chien. Je l'appelai Bigelow.        


        Nous sommes partis chercher des croquettes pour Bigelow, puis
        pour aller chez moi, ou nous pourrions nous asseoir dans des
        fauteuils et écouter du "Gorky's Zygotic
        Mynci":http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorky%27s_Zygotic_Mynci.
        Oh, et nous devions aussi nous arrêter afin d'acheter à
        Bigelow son propre fauteuil.        


        Mais Bigelow ne m'avait pas accepté pour maître. Aussi au bout
        de cinq minutes, ce chien stupide a choisi une autre route à
        un croisement et je ne l'ai plus jamais revu. Ainsi, tandis
        qu'il n'avait précédemment été perdu qu'une seule fois, il
        l'était maintenant deux fois. J'ai alors ralenti le pas qui me
        menait vers une vie faite de croquette et de fauteuils
        supplémentaires. J'ai eu un chien pendant cinq minutes.
        

        Quel chien stupide. Je m'assis sur un banc et jetais des
        pommes de pin sur la statue de trois chèvres traversant un
        pont. Après cela, j'ai pleuré pendant des heures. Les larmes
        coulaient toutes seules. Voilà quelque chose de poignant.


        Je me demande où il est allé avec tous ces ballons. Ce chien
        fou ressemblait à une fête sur pattes.


        Ce n'est que peu de temps après que j'ai joué mon propre
        Bigelow. J'avais imprimé un ensemble de pages sur Ruby. des
        articles trouvés sur le Net. Je les ai parcouru lors de mon
        trajet de retour, en train, un soir. J'ai joué avec pendant
        cinq minutes avant d'abandonner. Pas impressionné.


        Je m'assis, contemplant le monde depuis la fenêtre, un mixer
        géant mélangeant les graffitis et l'acier fondant devant
        moi. _Ce monde est trop grand pour un si petit langage_,
        pensais-je. _Cette pauvre petite chose n'a aucune chance. Même
        pas de jambe pour tenir debout. Même pas de bras pour nager._


        Et pourtant, j'étais là. Un petit homme sur un petit train
        fragile (et j'avais même encore une dent de lait à cette
        époque) parmi des milliards de personnes sur une pierre bleue
        flottante. Comment pourrais je dénigrer Ruby? Qui peut dire si je
        ne vais pas m'étouffer avec mon téléphone portable et mourir
        plus tard dans la soirée. Why mort, Ruby continuera à vivre.


        La pierre tombale:


        bq. Qu'y a-t-il dans sa trachée?

        Oh, regarde, un Nokia!



        Quelle chance. Finalement réussir à avoir un bon et long somme
        sous terre, juste pour être constamment dérangé par le "_Canon
        de Pachelbel_":http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachelbel sortant
        de mon estomac. 

    - Le Soleil Rouge Se Lève: >

        Donc, maintenant, vous vous demandez pourquoi j'ai changé
        d'avis quant à Ruby. La réponse rapide est: on s'est tapé dans
        l'oeil.


        Comme lorsque vous rencontrez Quelqu'un au lycée, et qu'il
        ressemble à Quelqu'un qui avait l'habitude de vous
        peinturlurer le visage quand vous êtiez enfant. Impulsivement,
        vous aviez conclus que ce Quelqu'un n'était pas un ami.  Vous
        critiquiez sa coiffure. Vous décrochiez bruyamment le
        téléphone aux moments cruciaux des histoires qu'il
        racontait. Vous utilisiez votre "baton
        sauteur":http://www.tpactivite.com/jeux_grands.php juste là où
        il essayait de marcher!


        Toutefois, six mois plus tard, vous et Quelqu'un bavardiez
        tranquillement à côté d'une fontaine. Il ne ressemblait plus à
        votre cauchemard d'enfance. Vous aviez trouvé le Bon
        Jumeau. Le coup de foudre.


        Aussi, là où je devrais sans doute vous assomer d'exagérations à
        propos de Ruby, ainsi qu'avec le lot d'acronymes pertinents
        qui l'accompagne partout (soulevant les sifflements collectifs
        de votre patron et du patron de votre patron), je vous
        laisserai juste faire une promenade. Je vous laisserai tomber
        dans du code, intervenant parfois avec mes propres
        expériences. Ce sera très simple, très naturel.


        Je devrais toutefois vous offrir quelque motivation. Aussi,
        Smotchkkiss, je vais vous donner mes trois meilleures raisons
        d'apprendre Ruby.


        # *Santé du cerveau.* <p>Vitamine R. Monte directememnt au
        cerveau. Ruby vous apprendra à _exprimer_ vos idées grâce à
        l'ordinateur. Vous écrirez des histoires pour une
        machine.</p><p>Le talent créatif, les
        gars. Déduction. Raison. Signe de tête intelligent. Ce langage
        deviendra pour vous un outil vous permettant de connecter
        votre esprit au monde. J'ai remarqué que beaucoup
        d'utilisateur expérimentés de Ruby semble avoir les idées
        claires et être objectifs. (A contrario de fortement partial
        et brut).</p>
        
        # *Un homme sur une île.* <p> Ruby est né au Japon. Ce qui est
        original. Le Japon n'est pas connu pour ses logiciels. Et
        puisque les langages de programmation sont principalement
        écrit en Anglais, qui suspecterait un langage de venir du
        Japon?<p><p> Et pourtant, nous avons Ruby. Contre tout
        attente, Yukihiro Matsumoto a créé Ruby le 24 Février
        1993. Durant les dix dernières années, il a progressivement
        amené Ruby à une plus large audience. C'est noble, triomphant et
        tout ça. Supportez la diversité. Aidez nous à incliner la
        Terre juste un peu.</p>

        # *Libre.* <p>Utiliser Ruby ne coûte rien. Le code de Ruby
        lui-même est ouvert à tous. Aussi, ce livre est libre. Tout
        cela fait partie d'un grand et gros don qui devrait avoir un
        gros accroc.</p> <p>Vous pensiez que nous allons vous faire
        acheter des aspirateurs, du temps-partagé ou de faux
        Monets. Vous pensiez qu'il y aurait une présentation de 90
        minutes, à la fin de laquelle le propriètaire de la compagnie
        viendrait vous taper dans le dos pour conclure le
        marché.</p><p>Non, libre.</p>


        Maintenant, il est temps de commencer ce livre. Vous pouvez
        donc sortir votre surligneur et commencer à le promener sur
        chacun des mots captivants de cette phrase. Je pense que j'ai
        assez de laque et de fausse monnaie sur moi
        pour me sustenter jusqu'à la dernière page.

    - Comment Commencent Les Livres: >

        Bien, si vous avez jamais lu un livre, vous savez qu'aucun
        livre ne commence sans une parfaite synergie. Oui,
        synergie. Peut-être ne le saviez-vous pas. La synergie
        signifie que vous et moi sommes supposés coopérer afin de
        faire de la lecture de ce livre une expérience à part entière.


        Nous allons commencer ce livre par bien nous entendre lors de
        l'Introduction. Cette unité, cette *synergie* nous propulsera
        tout au long du livre, avec moi pour guide. Vous me donnerez
        un rassurant hochement de tête ou un rire pour m'indiquer votre progression.


        Je suis Peter Pan tenant votre main. Allez, viens Wendy!
        Deuxième étoile sur la droite puis tout droit jusqu'au matin.


        Un seul problème ici. Je ne m'entends pas bien avec les
        personnes. Je ne tiens pas bien les mains.


        N'importe qui dans mon équipe vous le dira. Aux Cérémonies
        d'Ouverture de Ce Livre (un évennement approvisioné sur des
        sièges de stade), j'ai découvert que les sandwiches au
        concombre n'était pas servi avec des essuie-mains. Du coup le
        beurre ne tenait pas bien avec les concombres... De toute
        façon, j'ai fait un bon show et mis le feu a plusieurs des
        camions publicitaires à l'entrée. J'ai éclaté des projecteurs et
        tout ça. J'ai eu ce fort rire de maniaque dans la
        nuit. C'était vraiment la pagaille.


        Mais comme je ne m'entends pas très bien avec les personnes,
        je n'avais invité personne à part moi au Cérémonies
        d'Ouverture de Ce Livre. Donc ce n'était pas vraiment
        embarassant. Je l'ai gardé secret et personne n'a encore
        découvert cela.


        Aussi, vous devez savoir que *synergies* ne veut pas
        exactement dire *synergie* dans ce livre. Je ne peux pas être
        en *synergie* normale. Non, dans ce livre, *synergie* veut
        dire des *renards de bande-dessinée*. Ce que je veux dire
        c'est que ce livre va commencer par un grand nombre de
        *renards de bande-dessinée*.


        Et je compte sur vous pour les transformer en *synergie*.


  - Un Tour Rapide (et J'Espère Sans Peine) de Ruby (avec des
    Renards de Bande-Dessinée):
    - >
      !i/the.foxes-1.png(Les renards apparaissent.)!


      Yeah, ils sont deux. Mon asthme revient, aussi dois-je prendre
      une bouffée de médicament maintenant. Je reviens dans deux minutes.


      !i/the.foxes-2.png(Renards dans des boites.)!
       

      On m'a dit qu'il vallait mieux être équipé d'un mouchoir pour ce
      chapitre. Quelque chose pour vous éponger le visage lorsque vous
      allez suer.


      En effet, nous allons faire un tour à travers le langage en
      entier. Comme allumer chaque allumette d'une boite, aussi vite
      que possible.


    - Le Langage et JE VEUX DIRE le Langage: >
        !i/the.foxes-3.png(Nos amis, ces deux renards impuissants,
        réalise finalement la gravité de leur embarras.)!


        Ma conscience ne me laisserais pas appeler Ruby un langage
        pour _ordinateur_. Cela impliquerait que le langage utilise
        principalement des termes de l'ordinateur. Que le langage est
        fait pour aider l'ordinateur en premier lieu. Et que donc,
        nous, les développeurs sommes des étrangers, cherchant à nous
        acclimater à l'ordinateur. C'est le langage de l'ordinateur et
        nous sommes les traducteurs pour le monde.


        Mais comment appelez-vous un langage, quand votre cerveau
        commence à penser dans ce langage? Quand vous commencez à
        utiliser les propres mots du langage pour vous exprimer. Une
        machine ne peut faire ça. Comment cela pourrait-il être le
        langage de la machine? C'est le notre, nous le parlons naturellement!


        Nous ne pouvons donc décemment pas l'appeler un langage pour
        _ordinateur_. C'est un _dialecte de développeur_. C'est le
        langage de nos pensées.


        *Lisez ce qui suit à haute voix, pour vous-même.*

        Dans les phrases françaises, les signes de ponctuation (telle
        que le point, le point d'exclamation, les parenthèses) sont
        des silences. La ponctuation ajoute du sens aux mots, en
        donnat des informations sur ce que l'auteur de lap hrase veut
        exprimer. Aussi lisons ce qui précède comme: _Cinq fois
        affiche "Odelay!"._


        Ce qui est exactement ce que fait ce petit programme en
        Ruby. L'exclamation en "Espagnol
        mutant":http://www.whiskeyclone.net/ghost/L/lordonlyknows.html
        de Beck s'affichera cinq fois à l'écran.


        *Lisez ce qui suit à haute voix, pour vous-même.*


        bq. @exit unless "restaurant".include? "aura"@


        Ici nous faisons un test réel basique. Notre program sortira
        (*exit*: le programmera s'arrètera) *à moins que* (*unless*)
        le mot *restaurant* ne contienne (*includes*) le mot
        *aura*. Encore une fois, en Français: _Arrête à moins que le
        mot restaurant n'inclue le mot aura._


        Avez-vous déjà vu un langage de programmation utiliser les
        points d'interrogation de façon si effective? Ruby utilise
        certains signes de ponctuation, comme les points d'exclamation
        ou d'interrogation, pour augmenter la lisibilité du code. Dans
        le code précédent nous posons une question, aussi pourquoi ne
        pas rendre cela explicite?


        *Lisez ce qui suit à haute voix, pour vous-même.*


        bq. @['pain', 'fromage', 'vin'].each { |food| print food.capitalize }@


        Bien que ce bout de code soit moins lisible et moins semblable
        à une phrase que le précédent, je vous encourage quand même à
        le lire à haute voix. Même si Ruby peut se lire parfois comme
        de l'Anglais, il se lit aussi parfois comme un Anglais plus
        concis. En traduisant complètement ce qui précède en Anglais,
        vous auriez: _With the words 'pain', 'fromage', and 'vin':
        take each food and print it capitalized._ (NDT: En Français:
        _Avec les mots 'pain', 'fromage' et 'vin': prendre chaque
        nourriture et l'afficher avec la première lettre en
        majuscule._)
        

        L'ordinateur repondra alors courtoisement: @Pain@, @Fromage@ et @Vin@.


        Maintenant, vous devez vous demander comment ces mots vont en
        fait ensembles. Smotchkkiss se demande ce que signifient les
        points et les crochets. Je vais maintenant traiter les
        différents _constituants du discours_.


        Tout ce que vous avez besoin de savoir est que Ruby est, à la
        base, fait de phrases. Ce ne sont pas exactement des phrases
        anglaises. Ce sont des ensembles de mots et de signes de
        ponctuation qui entourent une idée simple. Ces phrases peuvent
        former des livres. Elles peuvent former des pages. elles
        peuvent former des nouvelles entières, en les assemblant. Ces
        nouvelles peuvent être lues par des humains, mais aussi par
        des ordinateurs.

        Les mecs, les procès n'en valent pas la peine. Aussi je
        vais directement accepter le piratage. N'importe qui désirant
        lire ce livre doit être capable de le faire. Je serais flatté
        si quelqu'un désire commercialiser ce livre ou faire des
        éditions spéciales.


        Pourquoi désirerais-je de l'argent? IGNOREZ TOUTES LES AUTRES
        COLONNES: j'ai perdu toute volonté de devenir un plouc
        riche. Cela semble inhumain, mais j'aime ma petite télé en
        noir et blanc. Ansi que ma lampe-fleur en plastique. Je ne
        veux pas devenir un écrivain. Le cash ne m'inspire pas. Aucun
        intérêt.


        Aussi, si l'argent ne veut rien dire pour le cadavre chanceux
        (NDT: "why the lucky stiff" se traduit par "why le cadavre
        chanceux"), pourquoi me pomper quand vous pouvez coopter des
        pratiques commerciales louches pour litéralement anéantir mon
        pshychisme et laisser mes poumons d'acier pleins de suie?
        Sans parler de l'ironie qui consiste à utiliser mon propre
        travail contre moi!  Meurs, Mec Poignant!


        Pour vous donner une idée de ce que je veux dire, voici
        quelques concepts sournois qui pourraient sérieusement
        endommager ma volonté et me forcer à reconsidérer certains
        choses comme l'existence.


        *PREMIERE IDEE: BEAUCOUP DE TABAC*


        Acheter une fabrique de cigarettes. Utilisez mes renards de
        bande-dessinée dans une campgagne publicitaire
        aggressive. Voilà un panneau d'affichage pour les débutants:


        !i/the.foxes-0a.png(La dépendance c'est comme les Pokemon!)!


        Dites explicitement que vous visez les enfants et les
        asthmatiques. Ensuite, une fois que vous avez fait marcher
        tout le monde, laissez les gens de *vérité* faire un exposé
        sur moi et ma ferme de renards d'encre.


        bq. *Hippie Sensible se Tenant Sur la Bordure du Trotoir dans
        le Désert Urbain*: Il s'appelle lui-même le macchabée chanceux.
        
        
        bq. (Il lève le rideau, révélant un corps gris sur brancard.)


        bq. *Le Hippie*: certains macchabées ne sont pas chanceux.


        bq. (Zoom erratique. Renards de bande-dessinée en
        surimpression pour un voyage subliminal à la Willy Wonka.)


        Hé. Pourquoi qu'tu fumes ces gros cigares comme ça, Holmes?


        *DEUXIEME IDEE: PELOTON D'EXECUTION*


        Comme je l'ai dit, vous pouvez commencer à vendre des copies
        de mon livre, mais en altérant le texte. Ces copies modifiées
        contiendraient des références flagrantes (et diffamatoires) à
        des agences gouvernementales, telles que les U.S. Marshals et
        le Pentagone. Vous pouvez me faire passer pour un vrai
        traitre. Comme si j'avais tous ces plans pour, vous savez,
        tuer certains des membres les moins désirables des
        U.S. Marshals ou du Pentagone.


        Non pas qu'il y ait des membres moins désirables chez les
        U.S. Marshals et au Pentagone. Euh, je ne voulais pas dire ça.


        Et mince.


        Et mince, mince, mince. 


        Eteignons les lumières. Baissons-nous.


        *TROISIEME IDEE: PANNEAUX D'AFFICHAGE, SECONDE PARTIE*


        Et pourquoi ne pas se moquer directement des asmathiques?


        !i/the.foxes-0b.png(Appelle le teuf-teuf! ROFL!)!


        *QUATRIEME IDEE: ALEC BALDWIN*


        Adaptez le livre au cinéma. Et comme je suis un personnage de
        ce livre, vous pourriez avoir quelqu'un comme Alec Baldwin
        pour jouer mon rôle. Quelqu'un qui est vraiment à un point bas
        de sa carrière.


        Vous pourriez faire comme si je prenais des tonnes de
        drogues. Comme si j'étais un aliéné avec qui l'on ne peut
        travailler.Comme si je virais les gens et les enfermais dans
        la salle des scooters en leur faisant porter une tenue en
        pain. Ouais, je pourrais en fait _cuire au four_ ces gens dans
        leur tenue.


        Je pourrais avoir un moule géant où j'attacherais les
        gens. Ensuite je verserais la pâte sur eux et les cuirais
        jusqu'à ce que le pain aie gonflé et qu'ils soient presque
        morts. Et quand les équipes de télévision arriveraient et que
        je serais dans 'Good Morning America', ils demanderaient,
        "Alors combien de personnes avez vous employées lors de
        l'écriture de votre livre?" et je répondrais "Une douzaine de
        chez le boulanger!" et éclaterais de ce rire lourd de maniaque
        qui forcerait les spectateurs à se boucher les oreilles.


        Bien sûr, en proie à ma folie, je déclarerais la guerre au
        monde. Les gens-pains livreraient un bon combat. Jusqu'à ce
        que les U.S. Marshals (ou le Pentagone) créent un cerveau
        robotique géant de singe (joué par Burt Lancaster) pour me
        poursuivre.


        Et voici là où vous me feriez paraître complètement
        piètre. Non seulement je sacrifierais tous les gens-pains (les
        Starchtroopers[1]) pour me sauver, non seulement je me
        rendrais comme un lâche au cerveau robotique géant de singe,
        mais quand je m'échapperais de justesse, je hurlerais vers les
        spectateurs. Vociférant avec insistance que c'est _MON_ film
        et que plus personne ne doit le regarder, je déchirerais
        l'écran en deux et le projecteur tournerait avec sa bobine
        s'agitant dans la défaite. Et ce serait la fin du film. Les
        spectateurs seraient _tellement_ ennuyés.


        fn1. NDT: Jeux de mots: "Starch" veut dire "Amidon" ... et
        "Starchtroopers" ressemble à "Starship troopers".



        Maintenant, je dois penser. Voyez, Alec Baldwin a fait un
        commentaire décent dans "La Famille
        Tenenbaums":http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm.html?cfilm=29188.
        Sa carrière est peut-être O.K. Vous ne voudrez peut-être pas
        l'utiliser. Il ne devrait pas le faire.


        Je vais vous dire. Je jouerais mon rôle. J'ai fait des points
        bas ma spécialité.
        
    - Les Constituants Du Discours: >

        Comme la raie blanche en bas du dos de la mouffette et
        l'enroulement blanc du cortège de la mariée, plusieurs des
        constituants du discours de Ruby ont des indices visuels afin
        de vous aider à les identifier. La ponctuation et la
        capitalisation aideront votre cerveau à voir des parties de
        code et à ressentir une intense identification. Votre esprit
        vous criera fréquemment _Hé, je connais ça mec!_ Vous serez
        aussi capable de placer ces noms dans les conversations avec
        d'autres Rubyistes.


        Essayez de vous focaliser sur l'apparence de chacuns de ces
        constituants. Le reste du livre detaillera chaque
        spécificité. Je donne une description courte pour chacun des
        constituants, mais vous n'avez pas à comprendre
        l'explication. A la fin de ce chapitre, vous devriez pouvoir
        reconnaître chaque partie d'un programme écrit en Ruby.


        h3. Variables


        N'importe quel mots constitué de lettres minuscules est une
        variable en Ruby. Les variables peuvent être constituées de
        lettres, chiffres ou de soulignés (NDT: _).


        bq. @x@, @y@, @banane2@ ou @telephoner_a_une_caille@ sont des
        exemples.


        Les variables sont comme des surnoms. Vous vous rappelez quand
        tout le monde vous appelait Pierre-Qui-Pue? Les gens disait,
        "Viens ici Pierre-Qui-Pue!" et tout le monde savait
        miraculeusement que vous étiez Pierre-Qui-Pue.


        Les variables vous permettent de donner un surnom à ce que
        vous utilisez fréquemment. Par exemple, supposons que vous
        dirigiez un orphelinat. C'est un orphelinat moyen. Et quand
        Papa Warbucks vient pour acheter plus d'enfants, on insiste
        pour qu'il paie *cent vingt et un euros et huit centimes* pour
        l'ourson en peluche de l'enfant, auquel il s'est attaché dans
        les moments sombres de sa vie de cauchemard.


        bq. @frais_d_ourson = 121.08@


        Plus tard, quand vous le retrouverez à la caisse
        enregistreuse (une caisse enregistreuse de première
        puisqu'elle tourne sous Ruby), vous devrez additioner ensemble
        toutes ces factures pour obtenir le *total*.


        bq. @total = frais_d_orphelin + frais_d_ourson + gratuite@


        Ces noms de variables aident vraiment. Et dans le milieu
        miteux de la vente d'enfants, je suis sûr que toute aide est appréciée.


        !i/the.foxes-4a.png(Ils se moquent de mes examples.)!
 


        h3. Nombres


        Le type le plus basique de nombre est l'_entier_ (_integer_),
        une *série de chiffres* qui peut commencer avec un *signe plus
        ou moins*.


        bq. @1@, @23@, et @-10000@ en sont des exemples.


        Les virgules ne sont pas autorisées dans les nombres, mais les
        soulignés (NDT: _) le sont. Donc, si vous sentez la
        nécessité de marquer les milliers afin que vos nombres soient
        plus lisibles, utilisez un souligné.


        bq. @population = 12_000_000_000@


        Les nombres décimaux sont appelés _flottants_ (_floats_) en
        Ruby. Les flottants sont faits de nombres avec une *partie
        décimale* ou une *notation scientifique*.


        bq. @3.14@, @-808.08@ et @12.043e-04@ en sont des exemples.



        h3. Les chaines de caractères


        Les chaines de caractères sont composées de n'importe quel
        caractère (lettre, chiffre, signe de ponctuation) entourés par
        des guillemets. A la fois les *guillemets* simples et doubles
        sont utilisés pour créer des chaines de caractères. 


        bq. @"laboratoire"@, @'2021'@ ou @"Ces bande-dessinées sont
        hilarantes!"@ en sont des exemples.


        Quand vous entourez des caractères par des guillemets, ils
        sont stoqués ensemble, comme une seule chaine.
        

        Pensez à un journaliste qui transcrit les divagations d'une
        célébrité. "Je suis beaucoup plus raisonnable," dit Avril
        Lavigne. "Maintenant, je sais à quoi ressemble le mileu -- ce
        que vous devez faire et comment le faire."


        <pre>
          avril_citation = "Je suis beaucoup plus
          raisonnable. Maintenant, je sais à quoi ressemble 
          le mileu -- ce que vous devez faire et comment le
          faire."
        </pre>


        De même que nous venions de stoquer un nombre dans la variable
        *frais_d_ourson*, nous stoquons maintenant une suite de
        caractères (une chaine) dans la variable *avril_citation*. Le
        journaliste envoie cette citation à l'impression, qui par
        chance, utilise Ruby pour faire fonctionner sa presse.


        <pre>
         <setup>
           oprah_citation = "O"
           avril_citation = "A"
           ashlee_simpson_debacle = "D"
         </setup>
         print oprah_citation
         print avril_citation
         print ashlee_simpson_debacle
        </pre>


        !i/the.foxes-4b.png(Ils veulent faire partie des mes exemples.)!



        h3. Symboles


        Les symboles sont des mots qui ressemblent à des
        variables. Encore une fois, ils peuvent contenir des lettres,
        des chiffres ou des soulignés. Mais ils *commencent avec deux
        points*.


        bq. @:a@, @:b@, ou @:ponce_de_leon@ en sont des exemples.


        Les symboles sont des chaines de caratères
        "légères". Généralement les symboles sont utilisés dans les
        situations ou vous avez besoin d'une chaine de caractères mais
        où vous ne voulez pas l'afficher à l'écran.


        Vous pouvez voir les symboles comme étant plus léger pour
        l'ordinateur. Ils sont comme un antiacide. Les deux points
        ressemblent aux bulles remontant de l'estomac de l'ordinateur
        alors qu'il digère le symbole. Ah, quel soulagement!


        !i/the.foxes-4c.png(Chunky bacon!!)!



        h3. Constantes


        Les constantes sont des mots, à l'instar des variables, mais
        elles commencent par une lettre majuscule. Si les
        variables sont les noms de Ruby, alors pensez les constantes
        comme étant les noms propres.


        bq. @Time@, @Array@ ou @Bunny_Lake_a_Disparu@ en sont des exemples.


        En Anglais (NDT: et en Français), les noms propres commencent
        par une majuscule. L'Empire State Building. Vous ne pouvez pas
        changer l'Empire State Building. Vous ne pouvez pas décider
        que l'Empire State Building désignera quelque chose
        d'autre. Les noms propres sont comme celà. Ils se rapportent à
        quelque chose de très spécifique et généralement ne changent
        pas au cours du temps.


        De la même façon, les constantes ne peuvent pas changer après
        avoir été assignées.


        bq. @EmpireStateBuilding = "350 5th Avenue, NYC, NY"@


        Si nous essayons de changer la constante, Ruby se plaindra. On
        désaprouve de telles pratiques.


        !i/the.foxes-4d.png(Allez, chunky bacon.)!



        h3. Méthodes


        Si les variables et les constantes sont les noms, alors les
        méthodes sont les verbes.
        Les méthodes sont généralement rattachées à la fin des
        variables par un *point*. Vous avez déjà vu des méthodes:


        bq. @porte_devant.ouvre@


        Dans l'exemple précédent, *ouvre* est la méthode. C'est
        l'action, le verbe. Dans certains cas vous pouvez voir des
        actions enchainées.


        bq. @porte_devant.ouvre.ferme@


        Nous avons demandé à l'ordinateur d'ouvrir la
        porte de devant et de la fermer immédiatement.


        bq. @porte_devant.est_ouverte?@


        Ce qui précède est aussi une action. Nous demandons à
        l'ordinateur de tester la porte afin de savoir si elle est
        ouverte. On aurait pu appeler la méthode
        @Porte.essaie_de_savoir_si_elle_est_ouverte@ mais le nom @est_ouverte?@ est plus
        succint et tout aussi correct. On peut utiliser à la fois les
        points d'exclamation et d'interrogation dans les noms de
        méthodes.


        h3. Les Arguments de Méthode


        Une méthode peut avoir besoin de plus d'information pour
        effectuer son action. Si nous voulons demander à l'ordinateur
        de peindre la porte, nous devons lui en indiquer la couleur.


        Les arguments des methodes sont attachés à la fin des
        méthodes. Ils sont générallement entourés par des
        *parenthèses* et séparés par des *virgules*.


        bq. @porte_devant.peindre( 3, :rouge )@


        Ce qui précède peint de 3 couches rouges la porte.


        Représentez le vous comme une chambre à air que la méthode
        traine avec elle. Les parentèses forment les bords ronds et
        humides de la chambre à air. Les virgules sont les pieds de
        chaque argument accrochés au bord. Le dernier argument a
        ses pieds sous lui de façon à les cacher.


        A l'instar d'un bateau pouvant remorquer plusieurs chambres à
        air, on peut enchainer les méthodes avec arguments.


        bq. @porte_devant.peindre( 3, :rouge ).seche( 30 ).ferme()@


        Ce qui pécède peint de 3 couche de rouge la porte, la sèche
        pendant 30 minutes et la referme. Même si la dernière méthode
        n'a pas d'argument vous pouvez quand même mettre des
        parenthèses si celà vous chante. Toutefois, il est inutile de
        trainer une chambre à air vide, donc on ommet généralement les
        parenthèses.


        Certaines méthode (comme @print@) sont des méthode de base
        (NDT: des méthodes du Kernel de Ruby). Ces méthodes sont
        utilisées partout en Ruby. Comme elles sont très fréquentes,
        on n'utilise pas le point.


        bq. @print "Voyez, aucun point."@


        h3. Méthodes de Classe


        Comme les méthodes dont on vient de parler (que l'on appelle
        aussi des méthode d'_instance_ (NDT: en anglais, _instance_
        methods)), les méthodes de classe sont généralement attachées
        aux variables et aux constantes. Plutôt qu'un point, on
        utilise *deux double points* pour les séparer.


        bq. @Door::new( :oak )@


        Comme on peut le voir, la méthode de classe @new@ est
        généralement utilisée pour créer de nouvelles choses. Dans
        l'exemple précédent, on demande à Ruby de nous créer une
        nouvelle porte en chêne. Bien sûr, Ruby doit savoir comment
        fabriquer une porte -- de même que du bois de charpente, des
        bucherons et ces longues scies à deux hommes.


        !i/the.foxes-4e.png(Plein de petits morceaux de bacon.)!



        h3. Variables globales


        Les variables commençant par un *signe dollar* sont globales.


        bq. @$x@, @$1@, @$chunky@ et @$CHunKY_bACOn@ en sont des exemples.


        La plupart des variables sont par nature
        temporaires. Certaines parties de votre programme sont comme
        de petites maisons. Vous y entrez et elles ont leurs propres
        variables. Dans une maison, vous pouvez avoir @papa@ qui
        représente Archie, le représentant de commerce et
        collectionneur de squelette. Dans une autre maison, @papa@
        peut représenter Pierre, un dompteur de lion ayant un penchant
        pour la flanelle. Chaque maison a sa propre signification pour @papa@.


        Avec les variables globales, vous avez la garantie que la
        variable sera la même dans chaque petite maison. Le signe
        dollar est tout à fait approprié à cela. Chaque foyer
        américain respecte la valeur du dollar. Nous en sommes
        dingues. Essayez de frapper à la porte de n'importe quelle
        maison américaine et tendez leur du fric. Je peux vous
        garantir que vous n'obtiendrez pas le même effet si vous
        frappez à une porte et leur offrez Pierre, le dompteur de lion
        ayant un penchant pour la flanelle.


        Les variables globales peuvent être utilisées n'importe où
        dans votre programme. Elles ne sont jamais perdues de vue.



        h3. Variables d'Instance


        Les variables commençant par une *arobase* sont
        des variables d'instance.


        bq. @@x@, @@y@, et
        @@only_the_chunkiest_cut_of_bacon_I_have_ever_seen@ en sont
        des exemples.


        Ces variables sont généralement utilisées pour définir les
        attributs de quelque chose. Par exemple vous pouvez fournir à
        Ruby la largeur de la @porte_devant@ en affectant une valeur à
        la variable @@largeur@ dans cette @porte_devant@. En Ruby, les
        variables d'instance sont utilisées pour définir les
        caractèristiques d'un objet donné.


        Pensez au symbole @arobas@ comme signifiant *attribut*. (NDT:
        marche mieux en anglais, où l'arobas se nomme *at*).


        h3. Variables de Classe


        Les variables commençant par une *double arobase* sont des variables de classe.


        bq. @@@x@, @@@y@, et @@@i_will_take_your_chunky_bacon_and_raise_you_two@ en sont des exemples.


        Les variables de classe sont aussi utilisées pour définir des
        attributs. Mais plutôt que de définir un attribut pour un seul
        objet en Ruby, les variables de classe définissent un attribut
        pour plusieurs objets apparentés. Si les variables d'instance
        définissent les attributs pour une seule @porte_devant@, alors
        les variables de classe définissent les attributs pour tout ce
        qui est une @Porte@.


        Pensez au *double arobas* comment signifiant *attributs
        pour tous* . Ou vous pouvez vous les imaginer comme un essaim
        de chasseurs *AT-AT* de _Star Wars_, tous commandés par Ruby
        (NDT: marche bien mieux en anglais ou l'arobase se nomme
        @at@). Vous modifiez une variable de classe et tous changent,
        pas seulement un.


        !i/the.foxes-4f.png(Woohoo! Chunky bacon terminé!)!



        h3. Blocs


        Tout code entourré par des *accolades* est un bloc.


        bq. @2.times { print "Oui, j'ai utilisé Chunky Bacon dans mes
        exemple, mais je ne le ferai plus!" }@ en est un exemple.


        Avec les blocs, vous pouvez grouper un ensemble d'instruction
        de façon à les transmettre au cours de votre programme.
        Les accolades ressemblents à des pinces de crabe qui auraient
        aggripé le code et le tiendrait groupé. Quand vous voyez ces
        deux pinces, rappelez vous que le code enserré a été compressé
        en une seule unité.


        C'est comme l'une des ces petites boites "Hello
        Kitty":http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty qu'ils vendent
        au supermaché, remplies de petits stylos et de papier
        microscopique, le tout empaqueté dans une petite trousse
        transparente et brillante qui tient dans le creux de la
        main. Mis à part que les blocs évitent de trop loucher.


        Les accolades peuvent aussi être remplacées par les mots *do*
        et *end*, ce qui est plus clair si votre bloc tient sur
        plusieurs lignes.


        <pre>
         loop do
           print "Beaucoup mieux."
           print "Ah. Plus d'espace!"
           print "J'avais mal au dos à cause de ces pinces de crabe."
         end
         <stdout>Beaucoup mieux.Ah. Plus d'espace!J'avais mal au dos à cause de ces pinces de crabe.</stdout>
        </pre>
        


        h3. Arguments de bloc


        Les arguments de bloc sont un ensemble de variables entourées
        par des *pipes* (NDT: |) et séparées par des *virgules*.


        bq. @|en||x|@, @|x,y|@, et @|up, down, all_around|@ en sont
        des exemples.


        Les arguments de bloc sont utilisés au début d'un bloc.


        bq. @{ |x,y| x + y }@


        Dans l'exemple précédent, @|x,y|@ sont les arguments. Le code
        se trouve après les arguments. L'expression @x + y@ ajoute
        les deux arguments ensembles.


        J'aime me représenter les deux caractères pipe comme un
        tunnel. Ils donnent l'impression d'un toboggan sur lequel les
        variables glissent. (@x@ descend en écartant les jambes, alors
        que @y@ croise les jambes.) Ce toboggan joue le rôle d'un
        passage entre les blocs et le monde qui les entoure.


        Les variables sont passées grâce à ce toboggan (ou tunnel) au bloc.


        !i/the.foxes-4g.png(And then, the dismal truth.)!



        h3. Intervalles


        Un intervalle est composé de deux valeurs entourées par des
        *parenthèses* et séparées par une *ellipse* (sous la forme de
        deux ou trois points).


        bq. @(1..3)@ est un intervalle, comprenant les nombres 1 à 3.


        bq. @('a'..'z')@ est un intervalle comprenant les lettres minuscules.


        Voyez-le comme un accordéon qui a été plié afin d'être
        transporté. (Bien sûr, le fait de vous promener avec un
        accordéon déplié peut vous apporter une grande vanité, mais
        parfois une personne a besoin de se vautrer dans le doute, en
        le transportant, plié, dans son étui.) Les parenthèses
        représentent les poignées sur les côté d'un bandoléon. Les
        points représentent la chaine qui maintient l'accordéon plié.


        Généralement, on utilise seulement deux points. Si un
        troisième point est utilisé, la dernière valeur de
        l'intervalle est exclue.


        bq. @(0...5)@ représente les nombres de 0 à 4 inclus.


        Quand vous voyez ce troisième point, imaginez que vous ouvrez
        légèrement l'accordéon. A peine assez pour laisser s'échapper
        une seule note. La note est la valeur de fin. Laissons-là
        monter vers le ciel.


        h3. Tableaux


        Un tableau est une liste entourée par des *crochets* et dont
        les éléments sont séparés par des *virgules*.


        bq. @[1, 2, 3]@ est un tableau de nombres.


        bq. @['coat', 'mittens', 'snowboard']@ est un tableau de
        chaine de caractères.


        Représentez le vous comme une chenille qui aurait été
        aggrafée sur votre code. Les deux crochets sont les aggrafes
        qui l'empèche de bouger, afin de noter où se trouvent la tête
        et la queue. Les virgules sont les jambes de la chenille
        frétillantes entre chaque section de son corps.


        Il était une fois une chenille qui avait des virgules à la
        place des jambes. Ce qui veut dire qu'elle devait faire une
        pause littéraire après chaque pas. Les autres chenilles la
        respectaient beaucoup pour cette particularité, et elle servait
        un peu de chef. Et sans parler d'un philanthrope! Il était
        connu pour donner des feuilles fraiches aux moins fortunées.


        Oui, un tableau est une collection de choses, mais il garde
        aussi ces choses dans un ordre spécifique.



        h3. Hachage


        Une table de hachage est un dictionnaire entouré par des
        *accolades*. Les dictionnaires font correspondre des noms à
        leur définition. Ruby indique celà par une *flêche*, faite
        d'un signal egal suivit par un signe supérieur.


        bq. @{'a' => 'aardvark', 'b' => 'badger'}@ en est un exemple.


        Cette fois, les accolades représentent de petits symboles en
        forme de livre. Regardez comme elles ressemblent à de petits
        livres ouvert, pliés en leur milieu. Ils représentent
        l'ouverture et la fermeture de notre dictionnaire.


        Imaginez que notre dictionnaire ait une définition sur chaque
        page. Les virgules représentent les coins de chacune des
        pages, que nous tournons pour voir la prochaine définition. Et
        sur chaque page: un mot suivi par une flêche poitant vers sa définition.


        <pre>
         {
           'nom' => 'Pierre',
           'profession' => 'dresseur de lion',
           'grand amour' => 'flannelle'
         }
        </pre>


        Je ne compare pas les tables de hachage aux dictionnaires pour
        indiquer que l'on ne peut stocker que des définitions dans les
        tables de hachage. Dans l'exemple précédent, j'ai stocké les
        informations personnelles de Pierre, le dresseur de lion avec
        un penchant pour la flannelle. Les tables de hachage sont
        comme les dictionnaires car elles permettent une recherche facile.


        A la différence des tableaux, les éléments d'une table de
        hachage ne sont pas gardés selon un ordre spécifique.

        !i/the.foxes-5.png(The foxes think silence will kill the comic.)!



        h3. Expression Régulières


        Un expression régulière(ou _regexp_) est un ensemble de
        caractères entourés par des *slashes*.


        bq. @/ruby/@, @/[0-9]+/@ et @/^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/@ en sont des
        exemples.


        Les expressions régulières sont utilisées pour trouver des
        mots ou des motifs dans du texte. Les slahes de chaque côté de
        l'expressions sont des épingles.


        Imaginez que vous ayez un petit mot avec des épingles de
        chaque côté et que vous le passiez sur le livre. Vous promenez
        le mot sur le texte et quand il s'approche d'un mot
        correspondant, il commence à clignoter. Vous épinglez alors
        l'expression régulière sur le livre, juste sur le mot
        correspondant et il fait briller les lettres du mot.


        Et quand vous plantez les épingles dans le livre, le papier
        éternue, "_reg-exp!_".


        Les expressions régulières sont beaucoup plus rapide que de
        passer vos mains sur les pages du livres. Ruby peut utliser
        une expression régulière pour chercher à travers énormément de
        livres très rapidement.


        h3. Opérateurs


        Vous utiliserez la liste suivantes d'opérateurs pour faires
        des maths en Ruby ou pour comparer des choses. Lisez la liste,
        essayez d'en reconnaître certains. Vous savez, l'addition @+@,
        la soustraction @-@ et tout celà...


        <pre class="text">
          ** !  ~  *  /  %  +  -  &  
          << >> |  ^  >  >= <  <= <=>
          || != =~ !~ && += -= == ===
          .. ... not and or          
        </pre>


        h3. Mots Clé


        Ruby comporte un certain nombre de mots-clé, imprégnés de
        signification. Ces mots ne peuvent être utilisés comme nom de
        variable ou modifiés afin de s'accorder à vos désirs. Nous
        avons déjà parlé de certains d'entre eux. Ils sont protégés mon
        ami. Vous les touchez et vous obtiendrez une erreur de syntaxe officielle.


        <pre class="text">
          alias   and     BEGIN   begin   break   case    class   def     defined 
          do      else    elsif   END     end     ensure  false   for     if 
          in      module  next    nil     not     or      redo    rescue  retry 
          return  self    super   then    true    undef   unless  until   when 
          while   yield 
        </pre>


        OK. Ce sont les illustres membres du langage Ruby. Nous allons
        en bouffer pendant les trois prochains chapitres, assemblant
        ces parties en de rusés petits bouts de code (poignant).


        Je recommande de lire toutes les parties du discours encore
        une fois. Ayez-en une bonne vue d'ensemble. Je vous testerai
        dans la prochaine partie.

#        h3. You and Your Dictionary 
#
#        You are out in a public park with your dictionary, enjoying a nice afternoon in the park.
#        A light breeze ruffles lexicon's pages carelessly in your lap.  A bird is gently beating
#        its head against a tree.  A tatterdemalion careens by on his unicycle.  All is well.
#
#        Hold up.  Your brain wonders about that word.  Tatterdemalion.  Does it really mean
#        "a shabbily clothed street urchin" like you think it means?  You look at your dictionary.
#
#        Now, here is the question.  How will you answer this question with your dictionary?  Where
#        will you start?  Will you go page-by-page, scanning for "a shabbily clothed street urchin,"
#        the definition?  Or will you use the dictionary's tabs to jump straight to the T section,
#        narrowing down the pages toward "tatterdemalion," the word itself?

      Sept Moments Zen dans Ma Vie: >

        # 8 ans. Allongé dans le lit, pensif. Et je réalise: _Rien ne
        m'empèche de devenir une enfant dentiste._

        # 21 ans. Je trouve un stylo sur la plage. Gravé dessus:
        _J'aime la sérénité._ A l'abri dans la poche intérieure de
        ma veste de costume. Je regarde les vagues aller et venir.

        # 22 ans. Je trouve, dans ma salle de bain, un scarabée sur le
        point de tomber dans le chauffage. Je le sauve. Je lui
        confectionne un petit sac à dos à l'aide d'une feuille et de
        fil. Dans le sac à dos: une quille et une pile AAA. Celà
        devrait l'aider. Je le libère devant le portail de devant.

        # 3 ans: J'écarte le rideau. Le soleil.

        # 14 ans. Je conduis mon vélo sur la jetée avec mon entraineur
        courant derrière moi pendant que le soleil se couche, juste
        après avoir battu Piston Honda dans la version originale
        Nintendo de "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out".

        # 11 ans. Malade. Je regarde
        "Heathcliff":http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosby_Show à la
        télévision. Pendant des heures. Et il était capable de venir
        juste devant moi. Sa tête tournoyant vers moi. Sa tête allant
        et venant d'avant en arrière, très près puis à des millions de
        kilomètres. Plus de son. En une fraction de seconde,
        Heathcliff avait rempli l'univers puis était parti au confin
        de l'infini. J'entendais la voix de ma mère qui essayait de me
        parvenir au travers de la série. Proche, loin, proche,
        loin. C'était une rave religieuse avec un chat stroboscope et
        la voix de ma mère comme une basse etoufée. (J'avais plus de
        40 de fièvre ce jour là).

        # 18 ans. Je m'achète un animal de compagnie. Un canard. Je le
        nourris pendant un temps. Je lui donne un bain. Je l'oublie
        pendant au moins 2 mois. Un jour, alors que je fais le ménage,
        je trouve une chaîne et le canard au bout. Eh, petit
        canard. Fou et monstrueux, sautillant avec ses cheveux au
        vent, poussant des gloussement en ligne diagonale. En smoking.


    - Si Je ne Vous Avez Pas Encore Assez Traité Comme un Enfant: >

        Je suis fier de vous. Tout le monde vous²q dira combien je vante vos
        mérites. Combien je glorifie cette personne anonyme, là-bas,
        qui fait défiler son écran et lit, et fait défiler son écran
        et lit. "Ces enfants", leur dis-je. "Mec, ces enfants m'ont
        eu. Je n'ai jamais ..." Et je ne peux même pas finir ma phrase
        car je pleure comme un veau.
        

        Et mon coeur brille d'un rouge vif sous ma peau vaporeuse et
        translucide, et ils doivent m'injecter 10 cm^3^ de Javascript
        pour me rétablir. (Je réponds bien au drogues dans le sang.)
        Mec, ce truc vous ferez sauter les pêches hors des ouies!


        Et oui. Vous avez gentillement persévéré . Mais maintenant je
        dois commencer à devenir un maître d'école brutal. Je dois
        commencer à voir de bonnes notes de votre part. Jusqu'à
        présent vous n'avez rien fait d'autre que beaucoup bouger vos
        yeux. OK, bien sûr vous avez fait quelques lectures à haute
        voix exceptionnelles plus tôt. Mais maintenant, Smotchkkiss,
        nous allons avoir besoin de quelques talents de compréhension.


        *Prononcez à haute voix les parties du discours utilisées
        plus bas.*


        bq. @5.times { print "Odelay!" }@


        Vous pouvez même vouloir revoir ce paragraphe pendant que vous
        lisez, car vos yeux voudront sauter vers la réponse. Nous
        avons le _nombre_ @5@, suivi de la _méthode_ @.times@. Ensuite
        la première paire de pince de crabe du _bloc_. La _méthode_ du
        kernel @print@ n'a pas de point et est suivie par la _chaîne
        de caractères_ @"Odelay!"@. La paire de pince de crabe
        terminale ferme notre _bloc_.


        *Prononcez à haute voix les parties du discours utilisées
        plus bas.*


        bq. @exit unless "restaurant".include? "aura"@


        A l'instar de la méthode @print@, @exit@ est une méthode du
        kernel. Si vous avez fait attention lors de la grande list de
        mots-clé, vous savez que @unless@ est un _mot-clé_. La _chaine
        de caratères_ @"restaurant"@ est suivi de la _méthode_
        @include?@. Et enfin, la chaîne de caratères @"aura"@.


        *Prononcez à haute voix les parties du discours utilisées
        plus bas.*


        bq. @['pain', 'fromage', 'vin'].each { |food| print( food.capitalize ) }@


        Cette chenille participe à notre délicat festin. Cet exemple
        commence par un _tableau_. Dans ce tableau, trois _chaînes de
        caratères_: @'pain'@, @'fromage'@, et @'vin'@. Ce tableau est
        suivi par la _méthode_ @each@.


        A l'intérieur d'un _bloc_, l'_argument de bloc_ @food@ descend
        par son toboggan à l'intérieur du bloc. La _méthode_
        @capitalize@ met ensuite en majuscule la première lettre de
        l'argument de bloc, qui est devenu la _variable_ @food@. Cette
        chaîne est alors passée à la _méthode_ de kernel @print@. 


        Relisez encore ces exemples. Soyez sûr de reconnaitre les
        différentes parties du discours utilisées. Elles ont toutes un
        look différent, n'est-ce-pas? Prenez une inspiration
        profonde, appuyez fermement sur vos tempes. Maintenant,
        disséquons un bout de code.

        
    - Un Exemple pour Vous Aider à Grandir: >

        !i/the.foxes-7.png(Gettin' cabin fever.)!


        *Prononcez à haute voix les parties du discours utilisées
        plus bas.*


        <pre>
         require 'net/http'
         Net::HTTP.start( 'www.ruby-lang.org', 80 ) do |http|
             print( http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' ).body )
         end
        </pre>


        La prmière ligne est un appel à une méthode. La _méthode_
        appelée @require@ est utilisée. Une _chaîne de caractère_
        contenant @'net/http'@ est passée à la méthode. Voyez cette
        première ligne de code comme une phrase. Nous avons demandé à
        Ruby de charger un code sensé nous aider, la bibliothèque @Net::HTTP@.


        Les trois lignes suivantes vont toutes ensembles. La
        _constante_ @Net::HTTP@ se rapporte à la bibliothèque que nous
        venons de charger précédemment. Nous utilisons la _méthode_
        @start@ de cette bibliothèque. Nous envoyons à la méthode la
        _chaîne de caractères_ @'www.ruby-lang.org'@ et le _nombre_ @80@.


        Le mot @do@ ouvre un _bloc_. Ce bloc possède une _variable de
        bloc_ @http@. Dans ce block, la _méthode_ @print@ est
        appelée. Qu'est-ce qui va être affiché?


        La _méthode_ @get@ est appelée depuis la _variable_
        @http@. Nous passons à @get@ une _chaîne de caractères_
        contenant le chemin @'/en/LICENSE.txt'@. Maintenant, remarquez
        qu'une autre méthode est enchainée avec @get@. La _méthode_
        @body@. Puis le bloc se termine avec un @end@.


        Tout va bien? Juste par curiosité, pouvez-vous deviner ce que
        fait cet exemple? J'espère que vous voyez certains motif de
        Ruby. Sinon, remuez votre tête vigouresement pendant que vous
        avez ces exemples à l'esprit. Le code devrait se casser en de
        petites sections que vous devriez comprendre.


        Par exemple, ce motif est utilisé plusieurs fois:


        bq. _variable_ . _méthode_ ( _argument de méthode_ )


        Vous le voyez dans le bloc:


        bq. @http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' )@


        On utilise Ruby pour obtenir une page web. Vous avez sans
        doute déjà utilisé HTTP avec votre browser. HTTP est
        l'Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP est utilisé pour
        transférer des pages web à travers Internet. Imaginez un
        conducteur de bus qui pourrait conduire à travers Internet et
        vous ramener des pages web. Sur son chapeau, brillent les
        lettres HTTP.


        La variable @http@ est ce conducteur de bus. La _méthode_ est
        un message au conducteur de bus. Va @chercher@ (NDT: @get@ en
        anglais) la page web nommée @/en/LICENSE.txt@.


        Aussi, là où vous verrez:


        bq. @http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' ).body@


        Comme nous récupérons une page web de la part du conducteur de
        bus nommé @http@, vous pouvez le lire dans votre esprit comme:


        bq. _page web_ .body


        Et ce bout de code:


        bq. @print( http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' ).body )@


        Ce code récupère la page web. Nous envoyons un message @body@
        à cette page web, ce qui nous donne tout l'HTML dans une
        _chaîne de caractères_. On _affiche_ (NDT: @print@ en anglais)
        ensuite cette chaine. Vous voyez comme le motif point-méthode
        est utilisé de façon chainée. Le prochain chapitre explorera
        ce genre de motifs en Ruby. Ce sera marrant.


        Alors, que fait ce code? Il affiche le code HTML de la "home
        page" du sitre officiel de Ruby à l'écran. En utilisant un

        !i/the.foxes-8.png(Running after the truck.)!


        Bien, maintenant nous avons un problème. J'ai l'impression que
        cette façon d'apprendre vous plait un peu trop. Et vous n'avez
        pas encore atteint le chapitre où j'utilise des chansons de
        saut à la corde pour vous aider à apprendre comment analyser
        du XML!
 

        Si celà vous plait déjà, alors les choses vont vraiment
        mal. Dans deux chapitres, vous écrirez vos propres
        programmes en Ruby. En fait, c'est juste là que je vous ferai
        écrire votre propre jeu de rôle, votre propre réseau de
        partage de fichiers (à la BitTorrent) ainsi qu'un programme qui
        récupèrera des nombres aléatoires depuis Internet.


        !>i/graph-1.gif(Proof has been extracted from the pudding.)!


        Et vous savez (vous devez savoir!) que celà va devenir une
        obsession. D'abord vous allez complètement oublier de sortir
        le chien. Il attendra près de la porte de votre bureau,
        tournant sa tête vers vous, alors que vos yeux dévoreront le
        code, que vos doigts enverront des messages à l'ordinateur.


        A cause de votre négligence, les choses vont commencer à aller
        mal. Vos tas de feuilles imprimées de code vont recouvrir vos
        conduits d'aération. Votre chaudière va se boucher. Les
        ordures vont s'amonceler: des boites à emporter que vous aurez
        commandé précipitamment, du courrier inoportun. Votre propre
        crasse polluera l'air. La mousse gagnera le chevron, les
        arrivées d'eau vont se boucher, les animaux entreront, et les
        arbres pousseront depuis les fondations.


        Mais vous prendrez soin de votre ordinateur. Et vous,
        Smotchkkiss, le nourrirez avec votre connaissance. Au cours
        des éternités que vous aurez passé avec votre machine, vous
        serez devenu à moitié CPU. Et il sera devenu à moitié
        humain. Vos bras pénètreront directement dans les ports de
        votre ordinateurs. Vos yeux accepteront la video directement
        depuis une broche DVI-24. Vos poumons se trouveront juste au
        dessus du processeur, et le refroidiront.


        Et juste comme la pièce sera prête à se refermer sur vous,
        juste comme tout cette luxuriance va vous avaler vous et votre
        ordinateur, vous terminerez votre script. Vous et votre
        machine, ensemble, ferez marcher ce dernier script Ruby, le
        produit de votre obsession. Et le script lancera des
        tronçonneuses pour couper les arbres, des cheminées pour aider
        à réchauffer la maison. Des nano-robots constructeurs
        sortiront de votre script pour reconstruire votre intérieur,
        re-carreler, rénover, chromer, polir et
        désinfecter. D'immenses piliers se dresseront, et des statues
        seront sculptées. Vous maintiendrez ce palais sous votre
        domination ainsi que les montagnes et îles qui entourent votre forteresse.


        Bon je pense que l'on va être d'accord. Qu'est-ce-que tu dis?
        Attaquons ce script?

      Je n'ai jamais vu un jambon faire autre chose que de perdre du
      jus. Aujourd'hui, dans les Cavernes d'Ambroise nous allons nous
      occuper de l'elfe. Il joue un rôle clé dans les prochaines
      leçons. Accueuillons le chaleureusement. Commencez à faire
      chauffer vos chapeaux d'écoute! (Et s'il vous plait, changez moi
      ce ridicule pantalon à étriers.)


      Un petit avertissement: cette leçon est beaucoup plus
      lente. Suivez là. Ce sera une longue et profonde
      respiration. L'étape la plus cruciale de votre instruction. Vous
      pouvez avoir tout d'abord l'impression que vous n'apprenez pas
      beaucoup à coder. Vous apprendrez des concepts. a la fin de ce
      chapitre, vous connaitre la beauté de Ruby. Le confort apporté
      par le code deviendra un sac de couchage pour votre propre réconfort.

        Trés bien, l'Elfe. Expliquez nous rapidement les problème de
        monnaies que vous rencontrez dans votre royaume.


        !i/the.elf-3.gif(Blue Crystals got the shaft.)!


        Hum, ce n'est pas ce dont je me rappelais. Cet Elfe m'appelait
        constament. Quand j'ai refusé de le rappeler, il a laissé un
        message sur mon pager. C'est à dire: il a bippé quelques fois
        et a ensuite imprimé un petit morceau de papier. Ce morceau
        disait quelque chose qui ressemblait à "Descends vite ici!" et
        aussi "Nous devons débarasser la Terre du fléau que ce sont
        ces chenilles, ces insectes tordus étouffent mes cristaux
        bleus !"


        Récemment, un taux de change a été instauré entre les feuilles
        et les cristaux. Un billet arboricole vaut cinq
        cristaux. Aussi la situation monétaire de base s'exprime comme ceci:


        <pre>
         cristal_bleu = 1
         feuille_tendre = 5
        </pre>


        Cet example ressemble _totalement_ au dernier chapitre. C'est
        déjà un début. Nosu assignons deux _variables_. Le *signe
        egal* est utilisé pour l'_affectation_.


        Maintenant @feuille_tendre@ représente le chiffre @5@ (comme
        dans: cinq cristaux bleus.) Ce concept est la *moitié de
        Ruby*. Nous _définissons_. Nous _créons_. C'est la moitié du
        travail. L'affectation est la forme la plus basique de définition.


        Vous ne pouvez quand même pas vous plaindre l'Elfe, n'est ce
        pas? Vous avez créer un empire en vendant vos cristaux bleus
        sur le nouveau marché entre les créatures de la forêt. (Et
        même s'il est un elfe pour nous, c'est un monstre immense pour eux.)

      The Scarf Eaters: >
      
        I hate to intrude upon your instruction, but I've already walked all over it enough to 
        warrant some further disregard.  Can I go over my next project with you?


        I've pledged to write another book.  (_Trombones_.)  The good news is that I won't actually
        be writing any of it.  You won't have to endure any more of this inane blathering.


        It's over between me and words.  I'd love to stick around and exploit them each, one after
        another, but it's all becoming quite predictable, wouldn't you say?  Eventually, they will
        all be used and I'd have to come up with fake words and that would be way too cnoofy.


        Now.  The deal isn't cut yet, but I'm in negotiations with Anna Quindlen to do my ghost writing.
        We're tag-teaming on a book that's going to blow the (Poignant) Guide right out of your hands. 
        To put it bluntly, the Guide will be worthless.  You won't be able to pile enough 
        pomegranates on top of the thing.


        So this new book.  The Scarf Eaters.  It's a coming-of-age novel.  But it's also a beginner's
        guide to Macromedia Flash.  It's like Judy Blume crossed Praystation.  It's like 0sil8 starring
        Hillary Duff.


        I don't want to give away the plot at all, but to tug your appetite I'll just say this:
        one kid talks to his dead brother in ActionScript.  More to come.


    - >
        Nonono.  Hang on a sec.  You're not ready for what the Elf here is doing in his caves.
        You'll think it's all positively inhumane, naughty, sick, tweeested, yada yada.


        h3.  Now You're Going to Hear the Animal Perfect Mission Statement Because This Is A
        Book And We Have Time And No Rush, Right?


        Back, back, way back before speedboats, I owned a prize race horse who took a stumble on 
        the track.  She did ten front flips and crashed into a guy who was carrying a full jar 
        of mayonnaisse.  We had blood and mayonnaisse up and down the track.  Needless to say, 
        she was a disaster.


        The vet took one look at her and swore she'd never walk again.  Her legs were gone and
        the vet wouldn't allow a legless horse to just sit around.  We'd need to put her down.  
        He swore his life and career on it, insisting we divide into two parallel lines.  The people 
        who could not refute the doctor's claims on one side; those too stubborn to accept his 
        infallable medical reasoning on the other.  The Elf, his pet ham, and I were the only 
        ones in that second line.


        So while the others heaped up trophies and great wreaths around the horse, bidding it a 
        fond farewell before the bullet came to take him home, the Elf and I frantically pawed the Internet for 
        answers.  We took matter into our own hands, cauterizing her leg wounds with live crawdads.  
        It worked great!  We now had a horse again.   Or at least: a horse body with a crustaceous abdominal
        frosting.  


        She scurried everywhere after that and lived for years in pleasantly moist underground cavities.


        Animal Perfect is now the future of animal enhancement.  They build new animals and salvage 
        old-style animals for parts.  Of course, they've come a long ways.
        When Animal Perfect started, you'd see a full-grown bear walk into Animal Perfect and you'd
        see a full-grown bear with sunglasses walk out.  Completely cheesy.


        Stick around and you'll see a crab with _his own jet pack_.  That's a new 2004 model jetcrab.


        But now, the whole operation is up and running.  And the cleanliness of the place is astonishing.
        All the equipment is so shiny.  Everything is in chrome.  Oh, and all the staff have concealed
        weapons.  They're trained to kill anyone who enters unannounced.  Or, if they run out of bullets,
        they're trained to pistol whip anyone who enters unannounced.


        Elf, make me a starmonkey.


        !i/the.elf-5a.jpg(First, the star is caught.)!


        Some imaginary Ruby for you:


        bq. @pipe.catch_a_star@
        
        
        Variable @pipe@.  Method @catch_a_star@.  A lot of Rubyists like to think of methods as a message.
        Whatever comes before the dot is handed the message.  The above code tells the @pipe@ to
        @catch_a_star@.


        This is the *second half* of Ruby.  Putting things in motion.  These things you define and create
        in the first half start to _act_ in the second half.


        # Defining things.

        # Putting those things into action.


        So what if the star catching code works?  Where does the star go?


        bq. @captive_star = pipe.catch_a_star@


        See, it's up to you to collect the miserable, little star.  If you don't, it'll simply vanish.
        Whenever you use a method, you'll always be given something back.  You can ignore it or use it.


        _If you can learn to use the answers that methods give you back, then you will *dominate*._


        !i/the.elf-5b.jpg(Star is ratcheted to the monkey's face.)!


        Quickly then.


        bq. @starmonkey = ratchet.attach( captive_monkey, captive_star )@


        The @ratchet@ gets an @attach@ message.  What needs to be attached?  The _method arguments_: the
        @captive_monkey@ and the @captive_star@.  We are given back a @starmonkey@, which we have
        decided to hang on to.


        !i/the.elf-5c.gif(Frog on the hand.)!


        This is turning out to be such a short, little proggie that I'm just going to put it
        all together as one statement.


        bq. @starmonkey = ratchet.attach( captive_monkey, pipe.catch_a_star ) + deco_hand_frog@


        See how @pipe.catch_a_star@ is right in the arguments for the method?  The caught 
        star will get passed right to the ratchet.  No need to find a place to put it.  Just
        let it go.


    - Small and Nearly Worthless: >

        !i/blix-1.gif(Law-va.)!


        The hotel here in Ambrose is no good at all.  The beds are all lumpy.
        The elevator is tiny.  One guy put all his bags in the elevator and found
        out there wasn't room for him.  He hit the button and chased up the stairs after
        it all.  But the stairwell turned out to be too narrow and his shoulders got wedged
        going up.  


        The soap mini-bars they give you are sized down for elves, so it's impossible to
        work up a lather.  I hate it.  I keep mistaking them for contact lenses.


        I turned on the faucet and nothing came out.  Thing is: Ambrose is
        a place with magical properties, so I took a chance.  I put my hands under
        the spigot.  Invisible, warm wetness.  I felt the hurried
        sensation of running water, darting through my fingers.  When I took
        my hands away, they were dry and clean.


        It was an amazing nothingness to experience.  It was just like @nil@.


        h3. Nil


        In Ruby, @nil@ represents an emptiness.  It is *without value*.  It isn't zero.
        Zero is a number.  


        It's Ruby's own walking dead, a flatlined keyword.  You can't add
        to it, it doesn't evolve.  But it's terribly popular.  This skeleton's smiling
        in all the pictures.


        bq. @plastic_cup = nil@


        The above @plastic_cup@ is *empty*.  You could argue that the @plastic_cup@
        contains something, a @nil@.  The @nil@ represents the emptiness, though, so
        go ahead and call it empty.


        Some of you who have programmed before will be tempted to say the @plastic_cup@ is
        *undefined*.  How about let's not.  When you say a variable is undefined,
        you're saying that Ruby simply has no recollection of the variable, it doesn't
        know the var, it's absolutely non-existent.


        But Ruby is aware of the @plastic_cup@.  Ruby can easily look in the @plastic_cup@.
        It's *empty*, but not *undefined*.


        h3. False


        !<i/blix-neg.gif(Shape of a cat.)!


        _The cat Trady Blix.  Frozen in emptiness.  Immaculate whiskers rigid.  Placid
        eyes of lake.  Tail of warm icicle.  Sponsored by a Very Powerful Pause Button._


        The darkness surrounding Blix can be called *negative space*.  Hang on to that phrase.
        Let it suggest that the emptiness has a negative connotation.  In a similar way,
        @nil@ has a slightly sour note that it whistles.


        Generally speaking, *everything in Ruby has a positive charge to it*.  This spark
        flows through strings, numbers, regexps, all of it.  Only two keywords wear a
        shady cloak: @nil@ and @false@ draggin us down.


        You can *test that charge* with an @if@ keyword.  It looks very much like the
        @do@ blocks we saw in the last chapter, in that both end with an @end@.


        <pre>
         if plastic_cup
           print "Plastic cup is on the up 'n' up!"
         end
        </pre>


        If @plastic_cup@ contains either @nil@ or @false@, you won't see anything print
        to the screen.  They're not on the @if@ guest list.  So @if@ isn't going to run
        any of the code it's protecting.


        But @nil@ and @false@ need not walk away in shame.  They may be of questionable
        character, but @unless@ runs a smaller establishment that caters to the bedraggled.
        The @unless@ keyword has a policy of *only allowing those with a negative charge in*.
        Who are: @nil@ and @false@.
        

        <pre>
         unless plastic_cup
           print "Plastic cup is on the down low."
         end
        </pre>


        You can also use @if@ and @unless@ at the *end of a single line of code*, if that's
        all that is being protected.


        <pre>
         print "Yeah, plastic cup is up again!" if plastic_cup
         print "Hardly. It's down." unless plastic_cup
        </pre>


        And another nice trick: stack the @if@ and @unless@.


        <pre>
         print "We're using plastic 'cause we don't have glass." if plastic_cup unless glass_cup
        </pre>


        This trick is a gorgeous way of expressing, _Do this only if *a* is true and *b* isn't
        true_.


        Now that you've met @false@, I'm sure you can see what's on next.

        h3. True


        bq. @approaching_guy = true@


        I saw @true@ at the hotel buffet tables today.  I cannot stand that guy.
        His stance is way too wide.  And you've never met anyone who planted his
        feet so hard in the ground.  He wears this corny necklace made out of
        shells.  His face exudes this brash confidence.  (You can tell he's exerting
        all of his restraint just to keep from bursting into Neo flight.)


        To be honest, I can't be around someone who always has to be right.
        This @true@ is always saying, "A-OK."  Flashing hang ten.  And seriously, 
        he loves that necklace.  Wears it constantly.


        As you'd suspect, he's backstage at everything on the @if@ event schedule.


        bq. @print "Hugo Boss" if true@ acts like @print "Hugo Boss"@.


        Occassionally, @if@ will haul out the velvet ropes to exercise some crowd control.  
        The *double equals* gives the appearance of a short link of ropes, right along the
        sides of a red carpet where only @true@ can be admitted.


        <pre>
         if approaching_guy == true
           print "That necklace is classic."
         end
        </pre>


        The double equals is simply *an ID check*.  Do the gentleman at both ends of this
        rope appear to match?


        In this way, you control who @if@ lets in.  If you have a hard time getting along with
        @true@ as I do, you can heartily welcome @false@.


        <pre>
         if approaching_guy == false
           print "Get in here, you conniving devil."
         end
        </pre>


        Same goes for @unless@.  The gateway is yours.  Take possession of it.


        h3. Again, I Want You to Dominate


        Now, you want a head trip?  *The double equals sign is a method.*  Can you guess how
        it works?  Here, check it out with the dot and parens:


        bq. @approaching_guy.==( true )@


        Ruby allows the shortcut, though.  You can drop the dot and back away slowly.


        Now, do you remember what you need to do to *dominate* in Ruby?  _Use the answers the
        methods give you._


        <pre>
         if nil.==( true )
           print "This will never see realization."
         end
        </pre>


        In the above, how is the method's answer being used?


        Let's take the statement @nil == true@.  This will fail every time.  No match.  
        When there's no match, the double equals method answers with @false@.  A shake of the head.
        That answer is given to @if@, who can't accept a @false@.  The @print@ never sees realization.


        <pre>
         at_hotel = true
         email = if at_hotel
                   "why@hotelambrose.com"
                 else
                   "why@drnhowardcham.com"
                 end
        </pre>


        Even though @if@ isn't a method, @if@ does give a return answer.  Look at the above and
        wonder over what happens when @at_hotel@ is @true@.


        The @if@ will return the answer given by the code it chooses to run.  In the case of 
        @at_hotel@ being true, the first string, my e-mail address at Hotel Ambrose, will be
        returned.  The @else@ keyword marks code which will run, should @if@ fail.  If @at_hotel@
        is false, the @if@ will answer with my e-mail address at Dr. N. Howard Cham's office, 
        where I take my apprenticeship.


        Should you have several lines of code in an @if@ or @unless@, *only the answer from the
        last full statement will be used*.


        <pre>
         email = if at_hotel
                   address = "why"
                   address << "@hotelambrose"
                   address << ".com"
                 end
        </pre>


        Three lines of code inside the @if@.  The first line assigns a string with my name in it to a variable.
        The second and third lines add the rest of my e-mail address on to the end.  The *double less-than @<<@
        is the concatenation operator*.  To concatenate is to *append*, or *add to the end*.


        Just as we saw with the equality checker @==@, the concatenator is a method.  After adding to the end
        of the string, the concatenator also *answers with that very string*.  So, the third line, which could be
        read as @address.<<( ".com" )@, gives back @address@, which the @if@ then hands back for @email@'s
        assignment.


        Here's a question: what if the @if@ fails?  What if @at_hotel@ is false in the above example?
        Is anything returned?  Nothing is assigned to @email@, right?


        Yes, nothing is returned.  By which I mean: @nil@ is returned.  And often @nil@ is a very
        useful answer.

        
        <pre>
         print( if at_hotel.nil?
                  "No clue if he's in the hotel."
                elsif at_hotel == true
                  "Definitely in."
                elsif at_hotel == false
                  "He's out."
                else
                  "The system is on the freee-itz."
                end )
        </pre>


        You can use the @nil?@ method on any value in Ruby.  Again, think of it as a message.
        To the value: "Are you nil?  Are you empty?"


        If @at_hotel@ is empty, Ruby doesn't have any idea if I'm in the hotel or not.  So @if@
        answers with the "No clue" string.  In order to handle the @true@ or @false@ possibilities,
        the @elsif@ keyword is used.  While you can have only one @if@ and one @else@, you can fill
        the inbetween with an exorbitant number of @elsif@ keywords.  Each @elsif@ acts as *a further @if@
        test*.  Checking for a positive charge.


        If you're doing okay at this point, then you're in tip-top shape for the rest of the
        book.  You have seen some pretty tough code in the last few examples.  You strong fellow.


    - Chaining Delusions Together: >

        !i/the.elf-6.jpg(55,000 starmonkeys and one spirited Olympic hopeful.)!


        You finish reading the above comic and retire to your daybed for reflection. It's one of
        those canopy affairs which is always logjammed with pillows.  You sit atop the pile,
        gazing out upon the world.  You see the tall smokestacks belching wide spools of fume and
        haze.  The tangled concourses of freeways smattered with swift, shimmering traffic is but
        a gently pulsing eye muscle from your vantage point.


        It is all so fantastic.  How the colors of the horizon spread across the landscape as a great
        mix of butter and grease with a tablespoon of vanilla extract.


        Yet, for all of the beauty which beckons for your attention, the images of the Elf and 
        his Olympic Hopeful return.  And more especially, that order for *55,000* starmonkeys.  
        _55,000 starmonkeys_, you think.  _Fifty-five Thousand_.


        You think of just the number itself.  _55,000_.  It's walking down a road.  It might be in
        a forest, you don't know for sure as your eyes are fixed right on the number itself.  It's stopping
        and talking to people.  To tennis players, to a men's choral group.  There is merriment and good 
        feeling.  When it laughs, its lower zeros quiver with glee.


        You want to talk to it.  You want to skip along that forest trail with it.  You want to climb
        aboard a jet bound to Brazil with it.  And after five days and four nights at the leisureful
        Costa do Sauipe Marriott Resort & Spa, to marry it, to bear a family of 55,000 starmonkeys with it.
        To take possession of Nigeria with it.


        With a flying leap, you dismount your pillow tower of isolation.  Scrambling with the key,
        you unlock your roll top desk and pull out a sheet of paper, holding it firmly upon the
        desk.  You begin scribbling.


        bq. _Take possession of Nigeria with my new 55,000 starmonkeys_... 

        _Over it, build Nigeria-sized *vegetarians only* casino and go-cart arena_...

        Wow, the ideas are really coming out.  You literally had to smack yourself to stop.  We need to put these
        in a safe place.  Actually, we should store them on your computer and mangle the words.  You look out the
        window and watch for FBI.  I'm going to start this script.

 
        h3. The Flipping Script


        <pre>
         print "Type and be diabolical: "
         idea_backwards = gets.reverse
        </pre>


        Let this script be your confidante.  It will ask for evil plans and turn their letters backwards.
        The @gets@ method is *built into Ruby*.  It's a *kernel method* like @print@.  This method @gets@
        will pause Ruby to let you type.  When you hit _Enter_, @gets@ will then stop paying attention
        to your keyboard punchings and answer back to Ruby with a string that contains everything you typed.

        !i/ad-tiger.gif!:expansion-pak-1.html


        Want to start using Ruby alongside your reading?  Split your attention and head off to
        "Expansion Pak I: The Tiger's Vest":expansion-pak-1.html, a trite mini-chapter which
        will aid you in installing Ruby.  In addition, you'll learn how to use Irb and Ri, two
        teaching aids that come with Ruby which will really speed you up in your learning.


    - >
        The @reverse@ method is then used on the string that @gets@ is giving back.  The @reverse@ method
        is part of the @String@ class.  Which means that *anything which is a string has the @reverse@ method
        available*.  More on classes in the next chapter, for now just know that *a lot of methods are only
        available with certain types of values*.


        I don't think @reverse@ is going to cut it.  The authorities only need to put a mirror to
        "airegiN fo noissessop ekaT."  Bust us when starmonkeys start to touch down in Lagos.


        The capital letters give it away.  Maybe if we uppercase all letters in the string before
        we reverse it.

    
        <pre>
         idea_backwards = gets.upcase.reverse
        </pre>


        h3. Your Repetitiveness Pays Off


        You hand me a legal pad, doused in illegible shorthand.  Scanning over it, I start to
        notice patterns.  That you seem to use the same set of words repeatedly in your musings.  
        Words like _starmonkey_, _Nigeria_, _firebomb_.  Some phrases even.  _Put the kabosh on._
        That gets said a lot.


        Let us disguise these foul terms, my brother.  Let us obscure them from itching eyes that
        cry to know our delicate schemes and to thwart us from having great pleasure and many go-carts.
        We will replace them with the most innocent language.  New words with secret meaning.


        I start up a word list, a Ruby @Hash@, which contains these oft seen and dangerous words of yours.
        In the Hash, each dangerous word is matched up against a code word (or phrase).  The code word
        will be swapped in for the real word.


        <pre>
         code_words = {
           'starmonkeys' => 'Phil and Pete, those prickly chancellors of the New Reich', 
           'catapult' => 'chucky go-go', 'firebomb' => 'Heat-Assisted Living', 
           'Nigeria' => "Ny and Jerry's Dry Cleaning (with Donuts)",
           'Put the kabosh on' => 'Put the cable box on'
         }
        </pre>


        The words which are placed before the arrow are called *keys*.  The words after the
        arrows, the definitions, are often just called *values*.


        Notice the double quotes around @Ny and Jerry's Dry Cleaning (with Donuts)@.  Since
        a single quote is being used an apostrophe, we can't use single quotes around the
        string.  (Although, you can use single quotes if you put a backslash before the apostrophe
        such as: @'Ny and Jerry\'s Dry Cleaning (with Donuts)'@.)


        Should you need to look up a specific word, you can do so by using the *square brackets*
        method.


        bq. @code_words['catapult']@ will answer with the string @'chucky go-go'@.
        

        Look at the square brackets as if they are a wooden pallet the word is sitting upon.
        A forklift could slide its prongs into each side of the pallet and bring it down
        from a shelf back in the warehouse.  The word on the pallet is called the _index_.
        We are asking the forklift to find the index for us and bring back its corresponding
        value.


        If you've never been to a warehouse, you could also look at the brackets as handles.
        Imagine an industrious worker putting on his work gloves and hefting the index back to
        your custody.  If you've never used handles before, then I'm giving you about
        thirty seconds to find a handle and use it before I blow my lid.


        As with many of the other operators you've seen recently, the index brackets are
        simply a shortcut for a method.


        bq. @code_words.[]( 'catapult' )@ will answer with the string @'chucky go-go'@.


        h3. Making the Swap

        
        I went ahead and saved the Hash of code words to a file called *wordlist.rb*.


        <pre>
         require 'wordlist'

         # Get evil idea and swap in code words
         print "Enter your new idea: " 
         idea = gets
         code_words.each do |real, code| 
           idea.gsub!( real, code )
         end

         # Save the jibberish to a new file
         print "File encoded.  Please enter a name for this idea: "
         idea_name = gets.strip
         File::open( "idea-" + idea_name + ".txt", "w" ) do |f|
           f << idea
         end
        </pre>


        Script starts by pulling in our word list.  Like @gets@ and @print@, the @require@ method
        is a kernel method, you can use it anywhere.  I give it the string @'wordlist'@ and it will
        look for a file named *wordlist.rb*.


        After that, there are two sections.  I am marking these sections with comments, the lines that
        start with *pound* symbols.  Comments are *useful notes* that accompany your code.  Folks who
        come wandering through your code will appreciate the help.  When going through your own code
        after some time has passed, comments will help you get back into your mindset.  And there's
        software out there that can take your comments and build documents from them.  (RDoc and Ri --
        see Expansion Pak #1!)


        I like comments because I can skim a big pile of code and spot the highlights.


        As the comments tell us, the first section asks you for your evil idea and swaps in
        the new code words.  The second section saves the encoded idea into a new text file.


        <pre>
         code_words.each do |real, code| 
           idea.gsub!( real, code )
         end
        </pre>


        You see the @each@ method?  The @each@ method is all over in Ruby.  
        It's available for Arrays, Hashes, even Strings.  
        Here, our @code_words@ dictionary is kept in a Hash.  This @each@ method will hurry through
        *all the pairs of the Hash*, one dangerous word matched with its code word, handing each pair to the @gsub!@ method
        for the actual replacement.


        In Ruby, @gsub@ is short for _global substitution_.  The method is used to search and replace.
        Here, we want to find all the occurences of a dangerous word and replace with its safe
        code word.  With @gsub@, you provide the *word to find as the first argument*, then the *word
        to put in its place as the second argument*.


        Why aren't we hanging on to the answer from @gsub@?  Doesn't @gsub@ give us an answer back that
        we should keep?  You'd think the line would read:


        <pre>
         safe_idea = idea.gsub( real, code )
        </pre>


        Yes, with @gsub@ we'd need to hang on to its answer.  We're using a variation of @gsub@ that is
        totally hyper.  Notice the *exclamation mark* on the @gsub!@ used inside the @each@ block.  The
        exclamation mark is a sign that @gsub!@ is a bit of a zealot.  See, @gsub!@ will go ahead and
        *replace the words in @idea@ directly*.  When it's done @idea@ will contain the newly altered string
        and you won't be able to find the old string.


        Call @gsub!@ a *destructive method*.  It makes its changes to the value directly.  Whereas @gsub@
        will leave the value intact, answering back with a new string which contains the alterations.
        (Why must @gsub!@ scream when he descends upon his prey?  Merciless assailant!)


        h3.  Text Files of a Madman


        Let us now save the encoded idea to a file.


        <pre>
         # Save the jibberish to a new file
         print "File encoded.  Please enter a name for this idea: "
         idea_name = gets.strip
         File::open( 'idea-' + idea_name + '.txt', 'w' ) do |f|
           f << idea
         end
        </pre>


        This section starts by asking you for a name by which the idea can be called.  This name is used
        to build a file name when we save the idea.


        The @strip@ method is for strings.  This method *trims spaces and blank lines* from the *beginning
        and end* of the string.  This will remove the _Enter_ at the end of the string you typed.
        But it'll also handle spaces if you accidentally left any.


        After we have the idea's name, we open a new, blank text file.  The file name is built by adding
        strings together.  If you typed in @'mustard-plus-codeine'@, then our math will be: @'idea-' +
        'mustard-plus-codeine' + '.txt'@.  Ruby presses these into a single string.
        @'idea-mustard-plus-codeine.txt'@ is the file.


        We're using the class method @File::open@ to create the new file.  Up until now, we've used
        several kernel methods to do our work.  We hand the @print@ method a string and it prints the
        string on your screen.  One secret about kernel methods like @print@: they are actually *class
        methods*.


        bq. @Kernel::print( "55,000 Starmonkey Salute!" )@


        What does this mean?  Why does it matter?  It means @Kernel@ is the center of Ruby's universe.
        Wherever you are in your script, @Kernel@ is right beside you.  You don't even need to spell
        @Kernel@ out for Ruby.  Ruby knows to check @Kernel@.


        Most methods are more specialized than @print@ or @gets@.  Take the @File::open@ for
        example.  The creator of Ruby, Matz, has given us many different methods which which
        read, rename, or delete files.  They are all organized inside the @File@ class.


        bq. @File::read( "idea-mustard-plus-codeine.txt" )@ will answer back with a string
        containing all of the text from your idea file.


        bq. @File::rename( "old_file.txt", "new_file.txt" )@ will rename @old_file.txt@.


        bq. @File::delete( "new_file.txt" )@ will nuke the new file.


        These File methods are all *built right into Ruby*.  They are all just stored in a
        container called the @File@ class.  So, while you can safely call kernel methods
        without needing to type @Kernel@, Ruby doesn't automatically check the @File@ class.
        You'll need to give the full method name.
    

        <pre>
         File::open( 'idea-' + idea_name + '.txt', 'w' ) do |f|
           f << idea
         end
        </pre>


        We pass two arguments into @File::open@.  The first is the *file name to open*.  The second
        is a string containing our *file mode*.  We use @'w'@, which means to write to a brand-new
        file.  (Other options are: @'r'@ to read from the file or @'a'@ to add to the end of the
        file.)


        The file is opened for writing and we are handed back the file in variable @f@, which can
        be seen *sliding down the chute into our block*.  Inside the block, we write to the file.  When
        the block closes with @end@, our file is closed as well.


        Notice we use the *concatenator* @<<@ to write to the file.  We can do this because files have
        a method called @<<@ just like strings do.


        h3. Settle Down, Your Ideas Aren't Trapped


        Here, let's get your ideas back to their original verbage,
        so you can rumminate over their brilliance.


        <pre>
         require 'wordlist'

         # Print each idea out with the words fixed
         Dir['idea-*.txt'].each do |file_name|
           idea = File.read( file_name )
           code_words.each do |real, code| 
             idea.gsub!( code, real )
           end
           puts idea
         end
        </pre>


        By now, you should be up to snuff with most of this example.  I won't bore you with all of the
        mundane details.  See if you can figure out how it works on your own.


        We have an interesting class method here, though.  The @Dir::[]@ method searches a directory (some
        of you may call them "folders").  Just as you've seen with Hashes, the index brackets
        can be class methods.  (Can you start to see the shiny, glinting gorgeousness of Ruby?)


        So we're using the forklift to get those files in the directory which match @'idea-*.txt'@.  The
        @Dir::[]@ method will use the asterisk as a wildcard.  We're basically saying, "Match anything
        that starts with _idea-_ and ends with _.txt_."  The forklift shuffles off to the directory
        and comes back with a list of all matching files.


        That *list of files* will come in the form of @Array@ the Caterpillar, with a @String@ for each 
        file.  If you are curious and want to play with with @Dir::[]@, try this:


        bq. @p Dir['idea-*.txt']@ will print:


        bq. @['idea-mustard-plus-codeine.txt']@ (_an Array of file names!_)


        Yes, the @p@ method works like @print@.  But where @print@ is designed for displaying strings,
        @p@ will print _anything_.  Check this out. 
        

        bq. @p File::methods@ will print:


        bq. @["send", "display", "name", "exist?", "split",@ ... _a whole list of method names!_ @]@

      Excerpt from The Scarf Eaters: >

        (_from Chapter V: A Man in Uniform_.)


        In April, the callow lilies came back.  They stretched their baby angel wings out
        and reached for the world.  Gently, their tendrils caressed the sullen fence posts
        until even they lilted lovelier.


        From her bedroom window, Lara watched the lilies exude their staunch femininity.
        She slipped the tassels of a fresh, carpathian, embroidered scarf into her mouth and 
        ate slowly. The long cloth slid down her throat and tickled as it snaked along her
        esophagus.  She giggled and burped.


        Oh, how the flora drew her in.  Looking at flowers went so well with being a teenage girl. 
        She wanted to paint them, so she opened a new Flash template.  A blank movie this time.


        She set her cursor loose in the garden of her movie's viewable area.  Vector white lines
        below shorter vector yellow lines.  She selected the white lines and grouped them together.
        She even moved them to a new layer entitled "Cry, Baby Angel, Cry."  Then she
        converted them into a graphic object and moved them to the library.


        She felt a warm chill as she moved the long, white petals to her movie's library.  It
        felt so official.  _I choose you.  I name you.  Dwell in the comfort of my palace forevermore._
        

        Heh.  She laughed.  Colorado Springs was hardly a "palace."
        

        Since they had moved, Dad had only been home once.  He had barged through the front door in
        full uniform and had given quite a start to both Lara and her mother.  Her mother had even dropped
        a head of lettuce -- which head she had just finished washing -- in a pitcher of Lick-M-Aid.  
        

        The pitcher was just wide enough for the lettuce and it lodged in there pretty good.
        Dad came over and yanked at the moist head for sometime until declaring it FUBAR, in a
        voice both bemused and then crestfallen.  He tossed the clotted spout in the trash bin.


        It was only later that day that Lara's mother realized that she could have simply halved the
        lettuce with an electric knife.  Dad laughed and slapped his forehead.  He then went
        around and slapped Lara's forehead, and her mother's too, affectionately.


        "We just weren't thinking, were we?" is what he said.  "And who dares blame us?  We're
        a real family today.  And we shouldn't have to do anything else on the day we got
        our family back."


        Lara's smiled reflected across the glass of her monitor.  She chose the text tool and
        in 42 point serif typed: "Dad."  She created a path for it and let it tween off the
        right side of the screen.  She cried long after it was gone.

    - >
        Since you and I are becoming closer friends as we share this time together, I should
        probably let you in on a bit of the history going on here.  It's a good time for a break
        I say.


        First, you should know that Blix is my cat.  My second pet to Bigelow.
        Granted, we hardly see each other anymore.  He's completely self-sufficient.
        I'm not exactly sure where he's living these days, but he no longer lives in the antechamber
        to my quarters.  He emptied his savings account about seven months ago.


        He does have a set of keys for the house and the Seville.  Should he ever
        find himself stranded, I will gladly step away from our differences and entertain his
        antics around the house again.


        Make no mistake.  I miss having him around.  Can't imagine he misses my company, but
        I miss his.


        h3. A Siren and A Prayer


        I first saw Blix on television when I was a boy.  He had a starring role on a very gritty police drama
        called _A Siren and A Prayer_.  The show was about a god-fearing police squad that did
        their jobs, did them well, and saw their share of miracles out on the beat.  I mean
        the officers on this show were _great_ guys, very religious, practically clergy.  But, 
        you know, even clergymen don't have the good sense to kill a guy after he's gone too far.
        These guys knew where to draw that line.  They walked that line every day.


        So, it was a pretty bloody show, but they always had a good moral at the end.  Most times
        the moral was something along the lines of, "Wow, we got out of that one quick."  But there's
        serious camaraderie in a statement like that.

        
        The show basically revolved around this one officer.  "Mad" Dick Robinson.  People called
        him Mad because he was basically insane.  I can't remember if he was actually clinically
        insane, but people were always questioning his decisions.  Mad often blew his top and chewed
        out some of the other officers, most of whom had unquestionable moral character.  But we
        all know it's a tough world, the stakes are high out there, and everyone who watched the
        show held Mad in great regard.  I think everyone on the squad grew quite a bit as people,
        thanks to Mad's passion.


        The officers couldn't do it all themselves though.  In every single episode, they plead with a
        greater force for assistance.  And, in every single episode, they got their tips from a cat
        named Terry (played by my cat Blix.)  He was just a kitten at the time and, as a young boy
        tuning into _A Siren and A Prayer_, I found myself longing for my own crime-sniffing cat.
        Terry took these guys down the subway tunnels, through
        the rotting stench of abandoned marinas, into backdoors of tall, industrial smokestacks.  


        Sometimes he was all over an episode, darting in and out, preparing traps and directing traffic.
        But other times you wouldn't see him the whole episode.  Then you'd rewind through the whole show
        and look and look and look.  You'd give up.  He can't be in that episode.  


        Still, you can't bear
        to let it go, so you go comb through the whole episode with the jog on your remote, combing, pouring
        over each scene.  And there he is.  Way up behind the floodlight that was turned up too high.  The
        one that left Mad with permanent eye damage.  Why?  Why burn out the retinas of your own colleague,
        Terry?


        But the question never got answered because the series was cancelled.  They started to do special
        effects with the cat and it all fell apart.  In the last episode of the show, there is a moment where
        Terry is trapped at the top of a crane, about to fall into the searing slag in the furnace of an
        iron smelt.  He looks back.  No going back.  He looks down.  Paws over eyes (_no joke!_), he
        leaps from the crane and, mid-flight, snags a rope and swings to safety, coming down on a soft antelope
        hide that one of the workers had presumably been tanning that afternoon.


        People switched off the television set the very moment the scene aired.  They tried changing the name.
        First it was _God Gave Us a Squad_.  _Kiss of Pain_.  Then, _Kiss of Pain in Maine_, since the
        entire precinct ended up relocating there.  But the magic was gone.  I went back to summer school that year
        to make up some classes and all the kids had pretty much moved on to football pencils.

        
        h3. Blocks


        A couple years ago, I started teaching Blix about Ruby.  When we got to this part in his lessons,
        the part that covers blocks, he said to me, "Blocks remind me of Mad Dick Robinson."


        "Oh?"  I hadn't heard that name in awhile.  "I can't see how that could be."


        "Well, you say blocks can be difficult to understand."


        "They're not difficult," I said.  "A *block* is just *code that's grouped together*."


        "And Mad was just an officer, sworn to uphold his duty," he said.  "But he was a real miracle to
        watch out in the field.  Now, this first example you've shown me..."  He pointed to an
        example I'd written down for him.

        
        <pre>
         kitty_toys =
           [:shape => 'sock', :fabric => 'cashmere'] +
           [:shape => 'mouse', :fabric => 'calico'] +
           [:shape => 'eggroll', :fabric => 'chenille']
         kitty_toys.sort_by { |toy| toy[:fabric] }
        </pre>


        "This is a small miracle," he said. "I can't deny its beauty.  Look, there are my kitty toys, laid
        out with their characteristics.  Below them, the block, sorting them by fabric."


        "I apologize if your list of toys looks a bit tricky," I said.  Like you, he had learned about the
        Array, the caterpillar stapled into the code, with square brackets on each side
        and each item separated by commas.  (Ah, here is one: @['sock', 'mouse', 'eggroll']@.) 
        He had also been taught the Hash, which is like a dictionary, with curly braces on each end
        which look like small, open books.  Commas in the Hash between each pair.  Each word
        in the dictionary matched up with its definition by an arrow.  (Be beholden: @{'blix' => 'cat',
        'why' => 'human'}@.)
        

        "Yes, vexing," he said.  "It has square brackets like it's an Array, but with the arrows like it's a Hash.
        I don't think you're going to get away with that."


        "It does seem a bit subversive, doesn't it?"  I said, tease-nudging him with a spoon.  "I've done your kitty toy list
        in a mix of the two.  I'm using a shortcut.  Which is: *If you use arrows inside of an Array, 
        you'll end up with a Hash inside of that Array.*"


        "Oh, I see," he said.  "You criss-crossed 'em.  How neat!"


        "Yes, yes, you're on it," I said.  He was also very good with a protractor.  "I have three Arrays,
        each with a Hash inside.  Notice the plus signs?  I'm adding them into one big Array.  Here's
        another way of writing it..."  I jotted down.


        <pre>
         kitty_toys = [
           {:shape => 'sock', :fabric => 'cashmere'},
           {:shape => 'mouse', :fabric => 'calico'},
           {:shape => 'eggroll', :fabric => 'chenille'}
         ]
        </pre>


        One Array, which acts as our list of chew toys.  Three Hashes in the Array to describe each toy.


        h3. Sorting and Iterating to Save Lives


        "Let's sort your toys by shape now," I said.  "Then, we'll print them out in that order."


        <pre>
         kitty_toys.sort_by { |toy| toy[:shape] }.each do |toy|
           puts "Blixy has a #{ toy[:shape] } made of #{ toy[:fabric] }"
         end
        </pre>


        "How does @sort_by@ work?" asked Blix.  "I can tell it's a method you can use with Arrays.  Because
        @kitty_toys@ is an Array.  But what is @toy@?"


        "Okay, @toy@ is a *block argument*," I said.  "Remember: the skinny pipes on each side of @toy@ make it
        a *chute*."


        "Sure, but it looks like you're using it like a Hash.  Inside the block you have @toy[:shape]@.
        That looks like a Hash."


        "The @sort_by@ method is an *iterator*, Blix.  It *iterates*, or *cycles*, through *a list of things*.  You
        remember that episode when Mad..." 


        "Episode?" he said.  Yeah, he can't understand the concept of TV dramas.  
        Yeah, I've tried explaining.


        "Or, yeah, remember that one _eyewitness account_ we watched where Mad was trying to talk
        down that crazy spelling bee contestant from the ledge of an college library?" 


        "I remember it better than you because I was riding in a remote control plane."  Yep, it was
        one of those episodes.


        "Do you remember how Mad got the guy to come down?" I asked.


        "People in spelling bees love letters," said Blix.  "So what Mad did was a genius move on his part.
        He started with the letter A and gave reasons, for all the letters of the alphabet, why the guy
        should walk back down the building and be safe on the ground."


        "'A is for the Architecture of buildings like this,'" I said, in a gruff Mad voice.
        "'Which give us hope in a crumbling world.'"


        "'B is for Big Guys, like your friend Mad the Cop,'" said Blix.  "'Guys who help people all the time
        and don't know how to spell too great, but still help guys who spell really great.'"
        
        
        "See, he went through all the letters, one at a time.  He was _iterating_ through them." _It Err Ate Ing._


        "But the guy jumped anyway, Why.  He jumped off on letter Q or something."


        "'Q is for Quiet Moments that help us calm down and think about all of life's little pleasures,
        so we don't get all uptight and starting goofing around on tiptoes at the very edge of a big, bad building.'"


        "And then he jumped," said Blix.  He shook his head.  "You can't blame Mad.  He did his best."
        
        
        "He had a big heart, that's for sure," I said, patting Blix on the shoulder.


        <pre>
         kitty_toys.sort_by { |toy| toy[:shape] }.each do |toy|
           puts "Blixy has a #{ toy[:shape] } made of #{ toy[:fabric] }"
         end
        </pre>


        "As for your @sort_by@, it *starts at the top* of the list and *goes through each item*, one at a time.
        So @toy@ is one of those items.  With each item, @sort_by@ stops and *slides that item down the
        chute*, under the @toy@ name, and let's you figure out what to do with it."
 

        "Okay, so @toy@ takes turns being each of the different toys I have."


        "That's right," I said.  "You know how I've really been harping on _using the answers that methods give
        you_?  Here, we're simply looking up the toy's shape inside the block.  The block then answers to @sort_by@
        with the shape string, such as @"mouse"@ or @"sock"@.  Once it's done cycling through the whole list, @sort_by@
        will have alphabetically compared each of the shape strings and will give back a new sorted Array."


        h3.  An Unfinished Lesson


        "That's good enough for today," said Blix.  "Can I have a fresh saucer of milk, please?"


        I filled his saucer to the brim and he guzzled from it for some time while I took a poker and
        jabbed at coals in the fireplace.  My mind wandered and I couldn't help but think further of
        blocks.  I wondered what I would teach Blix next.


        I probably would have taught him about @next@.  When you are iterating through a list, you
        may use @next@ to *skip on to the next item*.  Here we're counting toys that have a non-eggroll
        shape by skipping those that do with @next@.


        <pre>
         non_eggroll = 0
         kitty_toys.each do |toy|
           next if toy[:shape] == 'eggroll'
           non_eggroll = non_eggroll + 1
         end
        </pre>


        I could also have taught him about @break@, which *kicks you out of an iterating loop*.
        In the code below, we'll print out (with @p@) each of the toy Hashes until we hit
        the toy whose fabric is chenille.  The @break@ will cause the @each@ to abruptly end.


        <pre>
         kitty_toys.each do |toy|
           break if toy[:fabric] == 'chenille'
           p toy
         end
        </pre>


        I never got to teach him such things.  I continued poking away at a particularly stubborn coal
        which was caught in the iron curtain of the fireplace and threatened to drop on my antelope
        skin rug.  


        As I hacked away ferociously at the black stone, Blix slipped away, presumably on
        the bus bound for Wixl, the very bustling metropolis of the animal economies.  Who knows, he may
        have first stopped in Ambrose or Riathna or any of the other villages along the way.  My
        instinct say that Wixl was his definitely his final stop. 


        Without any student to instruct and coax along, I found myself quite lonely, holed up in
        the estate.  In the stillness of the dead corridors, I began to sketch out a biography in the 
        form of this guide.


        I worked on it whenever I found myself bored.  And when I wasn't bored, I could always
        switch on _The Phantom Menace_ to get me in the mood.

      !i/dr.cham-1.gif(Through space and time... in his bell jar... on a mission to find himself...)!


      Frankly, I'm sick and tired of hearing that Dr. Cham was a madman.  Yes, he tried to bury
      himself alive.  Yes, he electrocuted his niece.  Yes, in fact, he did dynamite a retirement
      home.  But this was all with good cause and, in each case, I believe he took the
      correct course of action.


      I'm sure you'd like to side with popular opinion, but you're bound
      to feel some small trickle of admiration for him once he's taken time to teach you all 
      about Ruby's class definitions.
      And moreso when you learn about mixins.  And perhaps, by the end of the chapter, we can all
      start to look beyond the Doctor's grievous past and stop calling him a madman.


      So if you need to call him a madman, I'd start heading down to the train tracks to
      smash up some long flourescent light bulbs.  Get it out of your system right now, 
      before we dig in.

        If you give me a number, which is any year from Dr. Cham's life, I'll give you a synopsis of that
        time period.  And I'll do it as a Ruby method, so it's an independent piece, an isolated chunk of
        code which can be hooked up to the voice of a robotic volcano, when such a thing becomes the apex
        of authoritative voice talents.


        Okay, so I need you to notice @def@ and @case@ and @when@.  You've seen the Ranges, the closed
        accordions of @1895..1913@, back in chapter 3.  They contain both ends and in between.  And the
        backslashes at the end of each line simply ignore the _Enter_ key at the end of each line, assuring
        Ruby that there is _more of this line to come_.


        So, please: @def@ and @case@ and @when@.


        <pre>
         def dr_chams_timeline( year )
           case year
           when 1894
             "Born."
           when 1895..1913
             "Childhood in Lousville, Winston Co., Mississippi."
           when 1914..1919
             "Worked at a pecan nursery; punched a Quaker."
           when 1920..1928
             "Sailed in the Brotherhood of River Wisdomming, which journeyed \
              the Mississippi River and engaged in thoughtful self-improvement, \
              where he finished 140 credit hours from their Oarniversity."
           when 1929
             "Returned to Louisville to pen a novel about time-travelling pheasant hunters."
           when 1930..1933
             "Took up a respectable career insuring pecan nurseries.  Financially stable, he \
              spent time in Brazil and New Mexico, buying up rare paper-shell pecan trees.  Just \
              as his notariety came to a crescendo: gosh, he tried to buried himself alive."
           when 1934
             "Went back to writing his novel.  Changed the hunters to insurance tycoons and the \
              pheasants to Quakers."
           when 1935..1940
             "Took Arthur Cone, the Headmaster of the Brotherhood of River Wisdomming, as a \
              houseguest.  Together for five years, engineering and inventing."

           end

        </pre>


        The @def@ keyword.  Here is our first *method definition*.  A plain kernel method, which can
        be used anywhere in Ruby.  And how do we run it?


        <pre>
         puts dr_chams_timeline( 1941 )
        </pre>


        Which answers with "And this is where things got interesting."  It's the same story again and again:
        _use your answers._  I've set things up above so that the @case@ statement always answers with a string.
        And since the case statement is the final (and only) statement in the method, then the method
        answers with that string.  Trickling water spilling down from ledge to ledge.


        Let me be clear about the @case@ statement.  Actually, I should call it a @case..when@ statement,
        since they cannot be used separately.  The @case@ keyword is followed by a value, which is compared against
        each of the values which follow @when@ keywords.  The first value to qualify as a match is the one the
        case uses and the rest are ignored.  You can do the same thing with a bunch of @if..elsif@ statements,
        but it's wordier.
       

        <pre>
         case year
         when 1894
           "Born."
         when 1895..1913
           "Childhood in Lousville, Winston Co., Mississippi."
         else
           "No information about this year."
         end
        </pre>


        Is identical to:


        <pre>
         if 1894 === year
           "Born."
         elsif 1895..1913 === year
           "Childhood in Lousville, Winston Co., Mississippi."
         else
           "No information about this year."
         end
        </pre>


        The *triple equals* is a length of velvet rope, checking values much like the double equals.  It's just:
        the triple equals is a longer rope and it sags a bit in the middle.  It's not as strict, it's a bit
        more flexible.


        Take the Ranges above.  @(1895..1913)@ isn't at all *equal* to @1905@.  No, the Range @(1895..1913)@ is only
        truly *equal* to any other Range @(1895..1913)@.  In the case of a Range, the triple equals cuts you a break
        and lets the Integer @1905@ in, because even though it's not *equal* to the Range, it's *included* in the
        set of Integers represented by the Range.  Which is good enough in some cases, such as the timeline I put
        together earlier.


        Which actually looked like a timeline, didn't it?  I mean, sure, @dr_chams_timeline@ method is code, but
        it does read like a timeline, clean and lovely.

      Caring For You.  And Your Wellness.: >

        I need you to be in a good mental state for the latter half of this book.
        Now is the time to begin conditioning you.


        Let's start with some deep breathing.  Give me a good deep breath and
        count to four with me.  


        Here we go.  1.  2.  3.  4.   Now exhale.  You
        can feel your eyes.  Good, that's exactly it.


        Now let's take a deep breath and, in your mind, draw a hippopotamus
        as fast as you can.  Quick quick.  His legs, his folds, his
        marshmallow teeth.  Okay, done.  Now exhale.


        Take another deep breath and hold it tight.  As you hold it tightly in
        your chest, imagine the tightness is shrinking you down into a bug.
        You've held your breath so hard that you're an insect.  And all the
        other bugs saw you shrink and they loved the stunt.  They're clapping
        and rubbing their feelers together madly.   But you had an apple in
        your hand when you were big and it just caught up with you, crushed
        the whole crowd.  You're dead, too.  Now exhale.


        Give me a solid deep breath and imagine you live in a town where
        everything is made of telephone cords.  The houses are all telephone
        cords, the shingles, the rafters.  The doorways are a thick mass of
        telephone cords which you simply thrust yourself through.  When you
        go to bed, the bedspread is telephone cords.  And the mattress and
        box springs are telephone cords, too.  Like I said, everything is made
        out of telephone cords.  The telephone itself is made of telephone
        cords.  But the telephone cord going to the telephone is made out of
        bread and a couple sticks.  Now exhale.


        Breathe in.  1.  2.  3.  4.  Breathe out.


        Breath in.  1.  2.  Another short breath in.  3.  4.  Imagine both
        of your hands snapping off at the wrists and flying into your computer
        screen and programming it from the inside.  Exhale.


        Big, big deep breath.  Deep down inside you there is a submarine.
        It has a tongue.  Exhale.


        Breathe through your nostrils.  Deep breath.  Filter the air through
        your nostrils.  Breathing through the nostrils gives you quality air.
        Your nostrils flare, you are taking breaths of nature's air, the way
        God intended.  Imagine a floppy disk drive clogged up with orphans.
        And while it chokes on orphans, you have good, wholesome God's 
        breath in your lungs.  But that pleasurable, life-giving air will
        become a powerful toxin if held too long.  _Hurry, exhale God and
        nature's air!_


        Now, you will wake up, smoothing out the creases of this page in
        your web browser.  You will have full recollection of your
        whole life and not forgetting any one of the many 
        adventures you have had in your life.  You
        will feel rich and renewed and expert.  You will have no remembrance
        of this short exercise, you will instead remember teaching a rabbit
        to use scissors from a great distance.


        And as you will wake up with your eyes directed to the top of this
        exercise, you will begin again.  But this time, try to imagine that
        even _your shadow_ is a telephone cord.

        h3. But Was He Sick??


        You know, he had such bad timing.  He was scattered as a novelist, but his ventures into alchemy
        were very promising.  He had an elixir of goat's milk and sea salt that got rid of leg aches.
        One guy even grew an inch on a thumb he'd lost.  He had an organic health smoke that smelled like
        foot but gave you night vision.  He was working on something called Liquid Ladder, but I've never
        seen or read anything else about it.  It can't have been for climbing.  Who knows.


        One local newspaper actually visited Dr. Cham.  Their book reviewer gave him four stars.
        Really.  She did an article on him.  Gave him a rating.


        Just know that Dr. N. Harold Cham felt terrible about his niece.  He felt the shock treatment
        would work.  The polio probably would have killed her anyway, but he took the chance.


        On Sept. 9, 1941, after sedating her with a dose of phenacetin in his private operating room, he attached
        the conducting clips to Hannah's nose, tongue, toes, and elbows.  Assisted by his apprentice, a bespeckled
        undergraduate named Marvin Holyoake, they sprinkled the girl with the flakes of a substance the doctor
        called _opus magnum_.  A white powder gold which would carry the current and blatantly energize the girl,
        forcing her blood to bloom and fight and vanquish.
        

        But how it failed, oh, and how, when the lever was tossed, she arched and kicked -- and 
        *KABLAM!* -- and *BLOY-OY-OY-KKPOY!*  Ringlets of hair and a wall of light, and the 
        bell of death rang.  The experiment collapsed in a dire plume of
        smoke and her innocence (_for weeks, everyone started out with, "And she will never
        have the chance..."_) was a great pit in the floor and in their lungs.


        To Hannah, I code.


        <pre>
         opus_magnum = true
         def save_hannah
           success = opus_magnum
         end
        </pre>


        A method is its own island.  And what goes on inside is unaffected by the simple variables around it.
        Dr. Cham couldn't breach the illness of his niece, no more than an @opus_magnum@ variable can penetrate
        the steely exterior of a method.


        Should we run the @save_hannah@ method, Ruby will squawk at us, claiming it sees no @opus_magnum@.


        I'm talking about *scope*.  Microscopes narrow and magnify your vision.  Telescopes extend the
        range of your vision.  In Ruby, *scope* refers to a field of vision inside methods and blocks.


        A method's @def@ statement opens its vision.  Variable names introduced there will be seen
        by the method and kept meaningful until its @end@ closes its eyes.  You can pass data into a
        method by using arguments and data can be returned from the method, but the names used inside
        the method are only good for its scope.


        Some variables have wider scope.  Global variables like @$LOAD_PATH@, which start with a *cash*
        symbol, are available in any scope.  Instance variables like @@names@, which start with an *at*
        are available anywhere inside a class scope.  Same goes for class variables like @@@tickets@.
        Class and instance variables will be explored in a moment.


        Blocks have scope, but it's a bit fuzzier.  More flexible.


        <pre>
         verb = 'rescued'
         ['sedated', 'sprinkled', 'electrocuted'].
         each do |verb|
           puts "Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
         end
         puts "Yes, Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
        </pre>


        The block _iterates_ (spins, cycles) through each of the Doctor's actions.  The @verb@ variable
        changes with each pass.  In one pass, he's sedating.  In the next, he's powdering.  Then, he's
        electrocuting.


        So, the question is: after the block's over, will he have rescued Hannah?


        <pre class="result">
         Dr. Cham sedated his niece Hannah.
         Dr. Cham sprinkled his niece Hannah.
         Dr. Cham electrocuted his niece Hannah.
         Yes, Dr. Cham electrocuted his niece Hannah.
        </pre>


        Blocks are allowed to see variables in the vicinity.  The block noticed that the @verb@ variable
        existed and it overwrote its contents as it went along.  When the block completed and its tiny life 
        ended, the @verb@ variable came out a changed creature.


        If a block uses a variable which hasn't been used previously, though, then that variable vanishes at the
        end of the block.  The block's *scope* closes and the variable goes with it.  Say that @verb@ wasn't used
        before the block.


        <pre>
         ['sedated', 'powdered', 'electrocuted'].
         each do |verb|
           puts "Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
         end
         puts "Yes, Dr. Cham " + verb + " his niece Hannah."
        </pre>


        Pulls an error: @undefined local variable or method `verb'@.  Poof.


        It must be something difficult, even for a great scientist, to carry away the corpse of a young girl
        whose dress is still starched and embroidered, but whose mouth is darkly clotted purple at the corners.  
        In Dr. Cham's journal, he writes that he was tormented by her ghost, which glistened gold and scorched
        lace.  His delusions grew and he ran from hellhounds and massive vengeful, angelic hands.


        Only weeks later, he was gone, propelled from these regrets, vanishing in the explosion 
        that lifted him from the planet.


        And even as you are reading this now, sometime in these moments, the bell jar craft of our
        lone Dr. Cham touched down upon a distant planet after a sixty year burn.  
        As the new world came into view, as the curvature of the planet widened, 
        as the bell jar whisked through the upset heavens, tearing through sheets of aurora and
        solar wind, Dr. Cham's eyes were shaken open.


        !i/dr.cham-2.gif(Safe landing.  Amazement.)!


        What you are witnessing is the landing of Dr. Cham on the planet Endertromb.  From what I
        can gather, he landed during the cusp of the Desolate Season, a time when there really isn't
        much happening on the planet.  Most of the inhabitants find their minds locked into a listless
        hum which causes them to disintegrate into just vapid ghosts of one-part-wisdom and three-parts-steam
        for a time.


        My modest grasp of the history and climate of Endertromb has been assembled from hanging around
        my daughter's organ instructor, who grew up on the planet.


        !i/elderly-3.gif(Dead husbands could destroy the Doctor.)!


        I frequently drill my daughter's organ instructor in order to ensure that he can keep appointments
        adequately.  That he can take house calls at odd hours and promptly answer emergency calls.
        When he finally revealed to me that he was an alien whose waking day consisted of five-hundred
        and forty waking hours, I was incredibly elated and opened a contractual relationship with him
        which will last into 2060.

        
        For three days (by his pocket watch's account), Dr. Cham travelled the dark shafts of air,
        sucking the dusty wind of the barren planet.
        But on the third day, he found the Desolate Season ending and he awoke to a brilliant vista, 
        decorated with spontaneous apple blossoms and dewy castle tiers.


    - A Castle Has Its Computers: >

        !i/dr.cham-3.jpg(The panoramic vales of Sedna on Endertromb.)!


        Our intrepid Doctor set off for the alien castle, dashing through the flowers.  The ground belted
        past his heels.  The castle inched up the horizon.  He desired a stallion, but no stallion
        appeared.  And that's how he discovered that the planet wouldn't read his mind and
        answer his wishes.


        As my daughter's organ instructor explained it, however, the planet *could read minds* and it *could
        grant wishes*.  Just not both at the same time.


        One day as I quizzed the organ maestro, he sketched out the following Ruby code on a pad
        of cheese-colored paper.  (And queer cheese smells were coming from somewhere, I
        can't say where.)


        <pre>
         require 'endertromb'
         class WishMaker
           def initialize
             @energy = rand( 6 )
           end
           def grant( wish )
             if wish.length > 10 or wish.include? ' '
               raise ArgumentError, "Bad wish."
             end
             if @energy.zero?
               raise Exception, "No energy left."
             end
             @energy -= 1
             Endertromb::make( wish )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        This is the wish maker.  


        Actually, no, this is a *definition for a wish maker.*  To Ruby, it's a *class definition*.
        The code describes how a certain *object* will work.


        Each morning, the wish maker starts out with up to five wishes available for granting.
        A new @WishMaker@ is created at sun up.


        <pre>
         todays_wishes = WishMaker.new
        </pre>


        The @new@ method is a class method which creates a new, blank object.  It also calls the
        object's @initialize@ method automatically.  In the @WishMaker@ definition, you'll see
        the @initalize@ method, which contains a single line of code: @@energy = rand( 6 )@.


        The @rand( 6 )@ picks a number between 0 and 5.  This number will represent the number
        of wishes left in the day.  So, occassionally there are no wishes available
        from the wish maker.


        The random number is assigned to an *instance variable* which is named @@energy@.
        This instance variable will be available any time throughout the class.  The variable
        can't be used outside the *scope* of the class.


        In chapter three, we briefly looked at instance variables and decided to respect them
        as *attributes*.  (The *at symbol* could mean *attribute*.)  Instance variables can used
        to store any kind of information, but they're most often use to store bits of information
        about the object represented by the class.


        In the above case, each wish maker for the day has its own energy level.  If the wish maker
        were a machine, you might see a gauge on it that points to the energy left inside.
        The @@energy@ instance variable is going to act as that gauge.


        <pre>
         todays_wishes = WishMaker.new
         todays_wishes.grant( "antlers" )
        </pre>


        Okay, step back and ensure you understand the example here.  The @WishMaker@ class is
        an outline we've laid out for how the whole magic wish program works.  It's not the _actual_ genie in
        the bottle, it's the paperwork behind the scenes.  It's the rules and obligations the genie
        has to live by.


        It's @todays_wishes@ that's the genie in the bottle.  And here we're giving it a wish to grant.
        Give us antlers, genie.  (If you really get antlers from this example, I don't want to hear
        about it.  Go leap in meadows with your own kind now.)


        In the last chapter, the drill was: Ruby has two halves.


        # Defining things.

        # Putting those things into action.


        What are the actions in Ruby?  Methods.  And now, you're having a lick of the definition language
        built-in to Ruby.  Method definitions using @def@.  Class definitions using @class@.


        At this point in your instruction, it's easier to understand that *everything in Ruby is an object.*


        <pre>
         number = 5
         print number.next                  # prints '6'

         phrase = 'wishing for antlers'
         print phrase.length                # prints '19'

         todays_wishes = WishMaker.new
         todays_wishes.grant( "antlers" )
        </pre>


        And, consequently, each object has a class behind the scenes.


        <pre>
         print 5.class                       # prints 'Integer'
         print 'wishing for antlers'.class   # prints 'String'
         print WishMaker.new.class           # prints 'WishMaker'
        </pre>


        Dr. Cham never saw the wish maker as he hustled across the landspace.
        It lay far beyond his landing in the valley of Sedna.  Down sheer cliffs
        stuffed with layers of thicket, where you might toss your wish (written
        on a small 1" x 6" slip), down into the gaping void.  Hopefully it will
        land on a lizard's back, sticking to its spindly little horn.


        And let's say your wish makes it that far.  Well, then, _down the twisted wood_ goes
        the skinny salamander, scurrying through the decaying churches which had been
        *pushed* over that steep canyon ledge once and for all.  And the expired priest inside, _who
        weathered the fall_ as well, will kill the little amphibian -- strangle it
        to death with a blessed gold chain -- and save it for the annual _Getting To
        Know You_ breakfast.  He'll step on your precious little wish and, when the
        *thieves come*, that slip will still be there, stuck on his sole.  Of course,
        the thieves' *preferred method of torture* is to cut a priest in thin deli-shaved slices _from
        top to bottom_.  Who can cull evidence from that?  And when they chop that last thin
        slice of shoe sole, they'll have that *rubber scalp* in hand for _good luck_ and _good times_.
        But they *canoe* much too hard, these thieves.  They slap their paddles swiftly in the current
        to get that great _outboard motor mist_ going.  But the shoe sole is _on a weak chain_, tied
        to one man's belt.  And a *hairy old carp* _leaps, latches_ on to that minute fraction of
        footwear.  And the thieves _can try_, but they don't see _underwater_.  If they could, they'd
        see that *mighty cable*, packed with millions of _needly_ fiber optics.  Indeed, *that fish is
        a peripheral plugged* right into the _core workings_ of the planet Endertromb.  *All it takes
        is one swallow* from that fish *and your wish is home free!*


        And that's how wishes come true for children in this place.


        Once my daughter's organ instructor had drawn up the class for the wish maker, he then followed
        with a class for the planet's mind reader.


        <pre>
         require 'endertromb'
         class MindReader
           def initialize
             @minds = Endertromb::scan_for_sentience
           end
           def read
             @minds.collect do |mind|
                mind.read
             end
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Much as you've seen before, the @initalize@ happens when a new @MindReader@ object is created.
        This @initialize@ gathers scans the planet for mindshare.  It looks like
        these minds are stored in an array, since they are later iterated over using the @collect@ method.


        Both the wish maker and the mind reader refer to a class named @Endertromb@.  This class is
        stored in a file @endertromb.rb@, which is loaded with the code: @require 'endertromb'@.
        Often you'll use other classes to accomplish part of your task.  Most of the latter half of this
        book will explore the wide variety of helpful classes that can be loaded in Ruby.


        h3. Dr. Cham Ventures Inside


        But as Dr. Cham neared the castle, although the planet was aware of his thoughts, sensing his
        wonderment and anticipation, all Dr. Cham felt was deadness.  He tromped up the steps of its
        open gate and through the entrance of the most beautiful architecture and was almost certain it
        was deserted.


        For a while he knocked.  Which paid off.


        !i/castle-1.jpg(Blocky whale greeting.)!


        He watched the baby whale rise like a determined balloon.  He marvelled at his first alien introduction
        and felt some concern that it had passed so quickly.  Well, he would wait inside.


        As he stepped through the castle door, he felt fortunate that the door hadn't been answered by 
        a huge eagle with greedy talons, eager to play.  Or a giant mouse head.  Or even a man-sized hurricane.  
        Just a tubby little choo-choo whale.


        "Not a place to sit down in this castle," he said.


        At first, he had thought he had just entered a very dim hallway, but as his eyes adjusted, he saw
        the entrance extended into a tunnel.  The castle door had opened right into a passage made of 
        long, flat slabs of rock.  Some parts were congruous and resembled a corridor.  Other parts 
        narrowed, and even tilted, then finally tipped away out of view.


        The passage was lit by small doorless refrigerators, big enough to hold an armful of cabbage, 
        down by his feet.  He peered inside one, which was hollow, illuminated along all sides, and
        turning out ice shards methodically.


        He pawed the ice chips, which clung dryly to his fingertips, and he scrubbed his hands in the
        ice.  Which left some muddy streaks on his hands, but satisfied a small part of his longing to bathe.
        How long had it been?  Ten years?  Thirty?


        Along the passage, long tubes of cloth cluttered some sections.  Later, bright pixel matter in porcelain
        scoops and buckets.


        He happened upon a room which had been burrowed out of the tunnel which had a few empty turtle
        shells on the ground and a large illuminated wall.  He stared into the room, bewildered.  What could
        this be?  In one state of mind, he thought of having a seat on a shell.  This could be the entrace at
        last, some kind of receiving room.  On the other hand, spiders could pour out of the shell's hollow when he
        sat.  He moved on.

        
        h3. Meal in a Castle's Pocket


        As he journeyed along the passageways (for the central tunnel forked and joined larger, vacuous caverns), he picked up
        themes in some locations.  Groups of rooms infested with pumping machinery.  Cloth and vats of glue
        dominated another area.  He followed voices down a plush, pillowed cavity, which led him to a
        dead end: a curved wall with a small room carved at eye-level.


        He approached the wall and, right in the cubby hole, were two aardvarks eating at a table.


        They gazed at him serenely, both munching on some excavated beetle twice their size, cracked 
        open and frozen on its back on the table.


        "Hello, little puppets," he said, and they finished their bites and kept looking with their forks
        held aloof.


        "I wish my niece Hannah were here to meet you," he told the attentive miniature aardvarks.  "She'd
        think you were an intricate puppet show."  He peered in at the dining area, shelves with sets of
        plates, hand towels.  Half of a tiny rabbit was jutting out from the top a machine,
        creamy red noodles were spilling out underneath it.  A door at the back of the room hung ajar.  Dr. Cham could
        see a flickering room with chairs and whirring motors through the door.


        "Any child would want this dollhouse," he said.  "Hannah, my niece, as I mentioned, she has
        a wind-up doll that sits at a spindle and spins yarn.  It's an illusion, of course.  
        The doll produces no yarn at all."


        One of the aardvarks opened a trapdoor in the floor and pressed a button down inside, which lit.
        Then, a small film projector slowly came up on a rod.  The other aardvark sat and watched Dr. Cham.
       

        "But Hannah still reaches down into the dollhouse and collects all the imaginary yarn into a
        bundle.  Which she takes to her mother, my sister, who is very good at humoring Hannah.
        She sews a dress to the doll's dimensions, which Hannah takes back to the doll.


        "And she tells
        the doll, 'Here, look, your hard work and perserverance has resulted in this beautiful dress.
        You can now accept the Chief of Police's invitation to join him tonight at the Governor's
        Mansion.'  And she has a doll in a policeman's uniform who plays the part of the Chief. 
        He's too scrawny to be an actual Chief, that would require quite a bit of plastic."


        The aardvark responsible for the film projector loaded a reel and aimed the projector at the
        back wall.  The film spun to life and the aardvark took a seat.  A green square appeared on the
        wall.  The attentive aardvark stared at Dr. Cham still.


        "Your films are coloured," said Dr. Cham.  "What a lovely, little life."


        The film played on: a blue square.  Then, a red circle.  Then, an orange square.  The attentive
        aardvark turned away, watched the screen change to a pink triangle, and both aardvarks resumed eating.


        A purple star.  A red square.  With quietness settling, Dr. Cham could hear notes droning
        from the projector.  Like a slow, plodding music box trying to roll its gears along the train
        tracks.


        "Yes, enjoy your supper," said Dr. Cham and he politely tipped his head away, marching
        back up the path he'd taken.


        h3. Another Dead End Where Things Began


        He found himself lost in the castle's tunnels.  Nothing looked familiar.  He wasn't worried much,
        though.  He was on another planet.  He would be lost regardless.


        He wound through the tunnels, attempting to recall his paths, but far too interested
        in exploring to keep track of his steps.  He followed a single tunnel deep, down, down,
        which slanted so steeply that he had to leap across ledges and carefully watch his footholds.
        The gravity here seemed no different than Earth.  His legs were pulled into slides just
        as easily.


        Although he had no absolute way of knowing where he was, he felt certain that he had left
        the castle's boundaries.  This deep, this long of a walk.  It had been an hour since he'd
        entered through the door.  And, as the tunnel wound back up, he was sure that he would
        emerge into a new dwelling, perhaps even a manhole which he could peek out from and see
        the castle.  Perhaps he shouldn't have come so far down this route.  He hoped nothing was
        hibernating down here.


        The tunnel came to a stop.   A dark, dead end.


        !i/dr.cham-4.gif(At the end of the tunnels: a computer and a book.)!


        He had time.  So he read the book.  He read of the foxes and their pursuit of the porcupine who stole their
        pickup truck.  He read of the elf and the ham.  He saw the pictographs of himself and found he
        could really relate to his own struggles.  He even learned Ruby.  He saw how it all ended.


        Were I him, I couldn't have stomached it.  But he did.  And he pledged in his bosom to see
        things out just as they happened.


        On the computer monitor, Dr. Cham saw the flashing @irb@ prompt.  Like Dr. Cham, you might
        recognize the @irb@ prompt from "The Tiger's Vest":expansion-pak-1.html
        (the first expansion pak to this book, which includes a basic introduction to Interactive Ruby.)


        Whereas he had just been exploring tunnels by foot, he now explored the machine's setup with
        the prompt.  He set the book back where he had found it.  He didn't need it anymore.  This was
        all going to happen whether he used it or not.


        He started with:


        <pre>
         irb> Object::constants
           => ["Marshal", "String", "Dir", "LoadError", "Float", ... and so on ]
        </pre>


        This command lists all the top-level constants.  Classes are also listed as constants, so
        this list can be great to see what's loaded into Ruby at any time.


        He scanned the list for anything unfamiliar.  Any classes which didn't come with Ruby.
        @Marshal@, @String@, @Dir@, @LoadError@, @Float@.  Each of those came with Ruby.


        But further down the list:


        <pre>
         ... "Struct", "Values", "Time", "Elevator", "Range" ...
        </pre>
        

        _Elevator?_  Exactly the kind of class to poke around with.  He had a go.


        <pre>
         irb> Elevator::methods
           => ["method", "freeze", "allocate", ... another long list ... ]
         irb> Elevator::class_variables
           => ['@@diagnostic_report', '@@power_circuit_active', '@@maintenance_password']
         irb> Elevator::constants
           => []
        </pre>


        Looks like the @Elevator@ class had plenty of methods.  Most of these looked
        like they were the same methods every object has in Ruby.  For example,
        @method@, @freeze@ and @allocate@ come with every class in Ruby.  (@Elevator::freeze@
        would keep the @Elevator@ class from being changed.  @Elevator::allocate@ would
        make a new @Elevator@ object without calling the @initialize@ method.)


        The @class_variables@ were interesting to Dr. Cham.  This elevator appeared genuine.
        But no available @constants@.  This tells us there are no classes nested inside
        the @Elevator@ class.


        He tried to create an @Elevator@ object.


        <pre>
         irb> e = Elevator::new
         ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1), requires a password
                 from (irb):2:in `initialize'
                 from (irb):2:in `new'
                 from (irb):2
                 from :0
        </pre>


        He tried a few passwords.

 
        <pre>
         irb> e = Elevator::new( "going up" )
         AccessDeniedError: bad password
         irb> e = Elevator::new( "going_up" )
         AccessDeniedError: bad password
         irb> e = Elevator::new( "stairs_are_bad" )
         AccessDeniedError: bad password
         irb> e = Elevator::new( "StairsAreBad" )
         AccessDeniedError: bad password
        </pre>


        That was useless.  _Oh, wait!_  The maintenance password.  Listed in the @class_variables@.


        <pre>
         irb> Elevator::maintenance_password
         NoMethodError: undefined method `maintenance_password' for Elevator:Class
                 from (irb):1
                 from :0
        </pre>


        Hmm.  Instance variables are only available inside an object.  And class variables are only
        available inside a class.  How to get at that password?


        <pre>
         irb> class Elevator
         irb>   def Elevator.maintenance_password
         irb>     @@maintenance_password
         irb>   end
         irb> end
           => nil
         irb> Elevator::maintenance_password
           => "stairs_are_history!"
        </pre>
 

        Alright!  He got the password.  Did you see that?


        He added a class method to the @Elevator@ class.  Isn't that great how you can start a new class
        definition for @Elevator@ and Ruby just adds your changes to the existing class definition?


        Class methods are usually called with the *double colon*.  But, a period is fine as well.
        Since @Elevator@ is a class itself, Ruby will figure that if you call @Elevator.maintenance_password@,
        you're calling a class method.  The double colon simply helps make class methods obvious
        to the reader.


        And justly so.  Class methods are a bit unusual.  Normally you won't want to store information
        directly inside of a class.  However, if you have a bit of information that you need to
        share among all objects of a class, then you have a good reason to use the class for storage.
        It's understandable that the @@@maintenance_password@ would be stored in the class, instead of
        in each separate object.  This way, the objects can simply reach up into the class and see the
        shared password.


        Here's probably how the password protection works.


        <pre>
         class Elevator
           def initialize( pass )
             raise AccessDeniedError, "bad password" \
               unless pass.equals? @@maintenance_password
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Passwording a class like this is pointless, since anything in Ruby can be altered and 
        overwritten and remolded.  Dr. Cham had the password and ownership of the elevator is his.


        <pre>
         irb> e = Elevator.new( "stairs_are_history!" )
         #<Elevator:0x81f12f4 @level=4>
         irb> e.level = 1
        </pre>


        Dr. Cham was standing right there when the elevator doors, off behind the computer terminal,
        opened for him.  With an exasperated sense of accomplishment and a good deal of excitement
        surrounding all of the events that lie ahead, he stepped into the elevator and pressed 4.

      An Evening of Unobstructed Voltage: >

        I dug up this article from _The Consistent Reminder_, a Connecticut newspaper
        which ran the four star review of Dr. Cham.  Midgie Dare, the book reviewer
        who suddenly opened her critical eye to anything tangible, praised the Doctor for his
        manners and innovations in the very same daily edition that she defamed cantaloupe and docked
        Manitoba for having crackly telephone service.


        I got a kick out of the end of her article.  Here you go.


        bq. He dismounted his horse with unquestionable care for anyone who
        might be in the vicinity.  Attentive of all sides, he lowered himself
        from the saddle gently, slowing to a pace which must be measured in
        micrometers per second to be appreciated.


        bq. Those of us in his company
        found ourselves with maws agape, watching his boot touch down upon
        the ground.  So precise and clean a step that it seemed it would never
        meet the earth, only hover slight above it.  Then, before the landing
        had actually registered with any of us, we were off to the cuisine, whisked
        away in the shroud of gaiety that was always right in front of Harold Cham,
        always just behind him, and most especially concentrate directly
        in his own luminary self.


        bq. He also carried loosely at his side a capitally ignorant statesman's
        daughter, who spared us no leave from her constant criticisms of atheists
        and railway routes.


        bq. "At home, my efforts to light a candle were trounced upon
        by further train rumblings, which thrusted the match in my hand nearer the curtains!"
        She derided Dr. Cham for his waning grip
        on her forearm and became jealous when he was able to tune into a pleasurable
        woman's voice on the radio once we returned to the residence.


        bq. The dusk did settle, however, and we found ourselves in a communal daze beneath
        the thick particles of cotton drift that wafted through the polished piano room,
        quite entertained by the _Afternoon Nap Program_, which played their phonograph
        so quietly at the station that we could only hear the scratching of dead Napoleon's
        sleeves across the bedsheets.  I felt a great shriek inside me at the thought!
        Still, on yonder chairs, the two lovers kept an abrupt distance between themselves and 
        I felt encompassed by Dr. Cham's warm gaze and his playful tip of the sherry glass.

    - The Continued Story of My Daughter's Organ Instructor: >

        I know you may be alarmed to hear that I have a daughter.  You think my writing is indicative
        of a palsied or infantile mind.  Well, please rest.  I don't have a daughter.
        But I can't let that stop me from sorting out her musical training.


        As I was related these elaborate histories of the planet Endertromb, I found myself
        wandering through hallways, running my fingertips along the tightly buttoned sofas
        and soaking myself in the saturated bellowings of the pipes, as played by my daughter's
        organ instructor.  His notes resounded so deep and hollow in the walls of his manor
        that I began to casually mistake them for an ominous silence, and found it even
        easier to retreat into deep space with my thoughts.  To think upon the ancient
        planet and its darker philosophies: its flesh temples, tanned from the dermal remains
        of its martyrs; its whale cartels, ingesting their enemies and holding them within for
        decades, dragging them up and down the staircases of ribs; its poison fogs and its
        painful doorways; and, the atrocious dynasties
        of The Originals, the species which claims fathership to all of the intellegent beings
        across the universe.


        But, eventually, I'd hear those pipes of a higher octave sing and I'd be back in the very same
        breezy afternoon where I'd left.


        How interesting that even the breeze of our planet is quite a strange thing to some
        outsiders.  For he had also told me of the travellers from Rath-d, who ventured to Earth
        five centuries ago, but quickly dissipated in our air currents since they and their crafts
        and their armor were all composed of charcoal.


        I had sat at the organ, listening to his faint tales of his colony, while he punctuated his
        symphonies to greater volumes and the story would disappear for awhile, until the coda came back around.
        He spoke of he and his brothers piling into the hollow of his mother's tail and tearing the
        waxy crescent tissue from the inner wall.  Juicy and spongy and syrupy soap which bleached
        their mouths and purged their esophagus as it went down.  They chewed and chomped the stuff
        and it foamed.  After they ate, they blew bubbles at each other, each bubble filled with a dense
        foam, which they slept upon.  And early in the morning, when mother opened her tail again, she watched
        serenely as her babies lay cradled in the stew of dark meatballs and sweet, sticky froth.

        
        He spelled out all the tastes of Endertromb.  Of their salmon's starchy organs, which cooked
        into a pasta, and its eyes which melted into rich cream.  Of their buttermelon with tentacles.
        And he was just beginning to appreciate the delicacies as a child, only to be lifted from a
        schoolyard by a pair of upright pygmy elephants who reached at him, through the heavens, and
        snatched upon his collar with a vast length of crane.


        They transplanted him on Earth, led him from their craft, trumpeting their snouts loudly for the city of
        Grand Rapids to hear, then left, weeping and embracing each other.


        "But, strangely (em-pithy-dah), I learned upon, played upon (pon-shoo) the organs on my
        home (oth-rea) planet," he said.


        My daughter's organ instructor speaks these extra words you see in parentheses.  Who knows
        if they are from his native tongue or if they are his own soundful hiccups.  He keeps
        another relic from Endertromb as well: he has twelve names.


        "No, (wen-is-wen)," he said.  "I have one name (im-apalla) which is said (iff)
        many-many different ways."


        I call him Paij-ree in the morning and Paij-plo in the later evening.
        Since it is day as I write, I will call him Paij-ree here.


        h3. Mumble-Free Earplugs


        !>i/my.daughters.organ-1.gif(Alien at the keys.)!


        So I told Paij-ree, "Paij-ree, I am writing a book.  To teach the world Ruby."


        "Oh, (pill-nog-pill-yacht) nice," he said.  He's known Ruby longer than I have, but still:
        _I_ will be my daughter's Ruby instructor.


        And I said, "Paij-ree, you are in the book.  And the stories of your planet."  I talk to
        him like he's E.T.  I don't know why.  Just like how I said next, "And then maybe someday
        you can go home to your mom and dad!"


        To which he said, "(pon-shoo) (pon-shoo) (em-pithy-dah)."  Which is his way of speaking
        out loud his silence and awe.


        He wanted to see what I'd written, so I showed him this short method I've written for you.
    

        <pre>
         def wipe_mutterings_from( sentence )
           while sentence.include? '('
             open = sentence.index( '(' )
             close = sentence.index( ')', open )
             sentence[open..close] = '' if close
           end
         end
        </pre>


        "Can you see what this does, Paij-ree?  Any old Smotchkkiss can use this method
        to take all the incoherent babblings out of your speaking," I said.


        And I fed something he said earlier into the method.


        <pre>
         what_he_said = "But, strangely (em-pithy-dah), 
           I learned upon, played upon (pon-shoo) the 
           organs on my home (oth-rea) planet."
         wipe_mutterings_from( what_he_said )
         print what_he_said
        </pre>


        And it came out as a rather plain sentence.


        <pre>
         But, strangely , 
         I learned upon, played upon the
         organs on my home planet.
        </pre>


        "You shouldn't use that (wary-to) while loop," he said.  "There are lovelier, (thopt-er),
        gentler ways."


        In the @wipe_mutterings_from@ method, I'm basically searching for opening parentheses.  When I
        find one, I scan for a closing paren which follows it.  Once I've found both, I replace them and
        their contents with an empty string.  The @while@ loop continues until all parentheses are gone.
        The mutterings are removed and the method ends.


        "Now that I look at this method," I said.  "I see that there are some confusing aspects 
        and some ways I could do this better."  Please don't look down on me as your teacher for 
        writing some of this code.  I figure that it's okay to show you some sloppy techniques 
        to help you work through them with me.  So let's.


        Okay, *Confusing Aspect No. 1*: This method cleans a string.  But what if we accidentally
        give it a @File@?  Or a number?  What happens?  What if we run @wipe_mutterings_from( 1 )@?


        If we give @wipe_mutterings_from@ the number 1, Ruby will print the following and exit.


        <pre>
         NoMethodError: undefined method `include?' for 1:Fixnum
                 from (irb):2:in `wipe_mutterings_from'
                 from (irb):8
        </pre>


        What you see here is a rather twisted and verbose (but at times very helpful) little fellow
        called the *backtrace*.  He's a wound-up policeman who, at the slightest sign of trouble,
        immediately apprehends any and all suspects, pinning them against the wall and spelling out their
        rights so quickly that none can quite hear it all.  But it's plain that there's
        a problem.  And, of course, it's all a big misunderstanding, right?


        When Ruby reads you these Miranda rights, listen hardest to the beginning.  The first line
        is often all you need.  In this first line is contained the essential message.  And in
        the above, the first line is telling us that there is no @include?@ method for the number 1.
        Remember, when we were talking about the @reverse@ method in the last chapter?  Back then, I said,
        "*a lot of methods are only available with certain types of values*."  Both @reverse@ and
        @include?@ are methods which work with strings but are meaningless and unavailable for numbers.


        To be clear: the method tries to use to the number.  The method will start with @sentence@ set to 1.
        Then, it hits the second line: @while sentence.include? '('@.  Numbers have no @include?@
        method.  Great, the backtrace has shown us where the problem is.  I didn't expect anyone to pass in
        a number, so I'm using methods that don't work with numbers.


        *See, this is just it.*  Our method is its own little pocket tool, right?  It acts as its own
        widget independent of anything else.  To anyone out there using the @wipe_mutterings_from@
        method, should they pass in a number, they'll be tossed this panic message that doesn't
        make sense to them.  They'll be asked to poke around inside the method, which really isn't
        their business.  They don't know their way around in there.


        Fortunately, we can throw our own errors, our own *exceptions*, which may make more sense
        to someone who inadvertantly hands the wrong object in for cleaning.


        <pre>
         def wipe_mutterings_from( sentence )
           unless sentence.respond_to? :include?
             raise ArgumentError, 
               "cannot wipe mutterings from a #{ sentence.class }"
           end
           while sentence.include? '('
             open = sentence.index( '(' )
             close = sentence.index( ')', open )
             sentence[open..close] = '' if close
           end
         end
        </pre>


        This time, if we pass in a number (again, the number 1), we'll get something more sensible.


        <pre>
         ArgumentError: cannot wipe mutterings from a Fixnum
                 from (irb):3:in `wipe_mutterings_from'
                 from (irb):12
        </pre>


        The @respond_to?@ method is really nice and I plead that you never forget it's there.  The
        @respond_to?@ checks any object to be sure that it has a certain method.  It then gives
        back a @true@ or @false@.  In the above case, the incoming @sentence@ object is checked for an
        @include?@ method.  If no @include?@ method is found, then we raise the error.


        You might be wondering why I used a symbol with @respond_to?@.  I used a symbol @:include?@
        instead of a string @'include?'@.  Actually, either will work with @respond_to?@.


        Usually symbols are used when you are passing around the name of a method or any other Ruby construct.
        It's more efficient, but it also catches the eye.  The @respond_to?@ asks Ruby to look inside itself
        and see if a method is available.  We're talking to Ruby, so the symbol helps denote that.  It's not
        a big deal, Ruby just recognizes symbols quicker than strings.


        Now, *Confusing Aspect No. 2*: Have you noticed how our method changes the sentence?


        <pre>
         something_said = "A (gith) spaceship."
         wipe_mutterings_from( something_said )
         print something_said
        </pre>


        Did you notice this?  In the first line of the above code, the @something_said@ variable
        contains the string @"A (gith) spaceship."@.  But, after the method invocation, on the
        third line, we print the @something_said@ variable and by then it contains the cleaned
        string @"A  spaceship."@.


        How does this work?  How does the method change the string?  Shouldn't it make a copy
        of the string before changing it?


        Yes, absolutely, it should!  *It's bad manners to change strings like that.*  We've used @gsub@ and
        @gsub!@ in the last chapter.  Do you remember which of those two methods is a *destructive
        method*, which changes strings directly?


        Either we need to call this method @wipe_mutterings_from!@ (as a courtesy to all the other
        good folks out there that might use this method) or change the method to work on a copy of
        the string rather than the real thing.  Which is an easy change!  We just need to @dup@
        the string.


        <pre>
         def wipe_mutterings_from( sentence )
           unless sentence.respond_to? :include?
             raise ArgumentError, 
               "cannot wipe mutterings from a #{ sentence.class }"
           end
           sentence = sentence.dup
           while sentence.include? '('
             open = sentence.index( '(' )
             close = sentence.index( ')', open )
             sentence[open..close] = '' if close
           end
           sentence
         end
        </pre>


        The @dup@ method makes a copy of any object.  Look at that line we added again on its own:


        <pre>
         sentence = sentence.dup
        </pre>


        What a peculiar line of code.  How does @sentence@ become a copy of @sentence@?
        Does it erase itself?  What happens to the original @sentence@?  Does it disappear?


        Remember that variables are just nicknames.  When you see @sentence = "A (gith) spaceship."@,
        you see Ruby creating a string and then giving that string a nickname.


        Likewise, when you see @sentence = sentence.dup@, you see Ruby creating a new string and then
        giving that string a nickname.  This is handy inside your method because now @sentence@ is
        a nickname for a new copy of the string that you can safely use *without changing the
        string that was passed into the method*.


        You'll see plenty of examples of variable names being reused.


        <pre>
         x = 5
         x = x + 1
         # x now equals 6

         y = "Endertromb"
         y = y.length
         # y now equals 10
         
         z = :include?
         z = "a string".respond_to? z
         # z now equals true
        </pre>


        And, yes, sometimes objects disappear.  *If you can't get to an object through a variable, then
        Ruby will figure you are done with it and will get rid of it.*  Periodically, Ruby sends out its
        *garbage collector* to set these objects free.  Every object is kept in your computer's memory
        until the garbage collector gets rid of it.

        (_from Chapter VII: When Push Comes to Shove -- or Love_.)


        "Never say my name again!" screamed Chester, and with the same gusto, he turned back
        to the *File > Publish Settings...* dialog to further optimize his movie down to a 
        measley 15k.


#        Mrs. Cothway appeared in the vaulted entry way with three elegant Arabian horses,  
#        but Woody refused to look away from his Vaio and shaved another 6k off his movie.
#
#
#        And so she cantered with them to the laundry room entrace, which was fatal for each of the mares, as 
#        young Annabelle fed them too much 7-Up and Earmuffs.

        Oh, and one more thing about @dup@.  Some things can't be dup'd.  Numbers, for instance.  
        Symbols (which look like @:death@) are identical when spelled the same.  Like numbers.


        Also, some of the special variables: @nil@, @true@, @false@.  These are things that Ruby won't let
        you alter, so there's so point making a copy anyway.  I mean, imagine if you could change @false@
        to be @true@.  The whole thing becomes a lie.


        Perhaps *Confusing Aspect No. 3* is a simple one.  I'm using those square brackets on the 
        string.  I'm treating the string like it's an Array or Hash.  I can do that.  Because strings
        have a @[]@ method.


        When used on a string, the square brackets will extract part of the string.  Again,
        slots for a forklift's prongs.  The string is a long shelf and the forklift is pulling out a slab
        of the string.


        Inside the brackets, we pass the _index_.  It's the label we've placed right between the prongs
        where the worker can see it.  When it comes to strings, we can use a variety of objects as our 
        index.
        

        <pre>
         str = "A string is a long shelf of letters and spaces."
         puts str[0]       # prints 65 (the character code for an 'A')
         puts str[0..-1]   # prints 'A string is a long shelf of letters and spaces.'
         puts str[1..-2]   # prints ' string is a long shelf of letters and spaces'
         puts str[1, 3]    # prints 'A s'
         puts str['shelf'] # prints 'shelf'
        </pre>


        Alright, the last *Confusing Aspect No. 4*: this method can be sent into an endless loop.
        You can give this method a string which will cause the method to hang and never come back.
        Take a look at the method.  Can you throw in a muddy stick to clog the loop?


        <pre>
         def wipe_mutterings_from( sentence )
           unless sentence.respond_to? :include?
             raise ArgumentError, 
               "cannot wipe mutterings from a #{ sentence.class }"
           end
           sentence = sentence.dup
           while sentence.include? '('
             open = sentence.index( '(' )
             close = sentence.index( ')', open )
             sentence[open..close] = '' if close
           end
           sentence
         end
        </pre>


        Here, give the muddy stick a curve before you jam it.


        <pre>
         muddy_stick = "Here's a ( curve."
         wipe_mutterings_from( muddy_stick )
        </pre>


        Why does the method hang?  Well, the @while@ loop waits until all the open parentheses
        are gone before it stops looping.  And it only replaces open parentheses that have a matching
        closing parentheses.  So, if no closing paren is found, the open paren won't be replaced
        and the @while@ will never be satisfied.


        How would you rewrite this method?  Me, I know my way around Ruby, so I'd use a regular
        expression.


        <pre>
         def wipe_mutterings_from( sentence )
           unless sentence.respond_to? :gsub
             raise ArgumentError, 
               "cannot wipe mutterings from a #{ sentence.class }"
           end
           sentence.gsub( /\([-\w]+\)/, '' )
         end
        </pre>


        Do your best to think through your loops.  It's especially easy for @while@ and @until@ loops
        to get out of hand.  Best to use an iterator.  And we'll get to regular expressions in time.


        In summary, here's what we've learned about writing methods:


        # Don't be surprised if people pass unexpected objects into your methods.
        If you absolutely can't use what they give you, @raise@ an error.

        # It's poor etiquette to change objects your method is given.  Use @dup@ to
        make a copy.  Or find a method like @gsub@ that automatically makes a copy
        as it does its job.

        # The square brackets can be used to lookup parts inside any @Array@, @Hash@ or @String@ objects,
        as these objects provide a @[]@ method.  Also, since these objects provide a @[]=@ method,
        the square brackets can be used in assignment (on the left-hand side of the equals sign) to
        change the parts of those objects.

        # Watch for runaway loops.  Avoid @while@ and @until@ if you can.
 

        h3. The Mechanisms of Name-Calling


        !>i/my.daughters.organ-2.gif(Cat salesmen from the sky.)!


        Forthwith there is a rustling in the trees behind Paij-ree's house and it turns out to
        be a man falling from the sky.  His name is Doug and he sells cats.


        So, just as he comes into to view, when his shadow (and the shadows of the cats tied to his
        foot) obscures the bird on the lawn that we're trying to hit with a racquetball, 
        as he's squeezing a wisp of helium from his big balloon, we shout, "Hello, Doug!"


        And he says, "Hello, Gonk-ree!  Hello, Why!"


        Paij-ree checks his pockets to be sure he has the dollar-twenty-seven he'll need in order to
        buy the three cats he'll need to keep the furnace stoked and the satellite dish turning.  These
        cats generate gobs of static once Paij-ree tosses them in the generator, where they'll be
        outnumbered by the giant glass rods, which caress the cats continually-- But, wait!  Did you see
        how the cat broker called him Gonk-ree?

        
        And he calls him Gonk-ree in the morning and Gonk-plo at night.


        So the suffix is definitely subject to the sunlight.  As far as I can tell, the prefix indicates
        the namecaller's relationship to Paij-ree.

        
        <pre>
         class String

           # The parts of my daughter's organ
           # instructor's name.
           @@syllables = [
             { 'Paij' => 'Personal',
               'Gonk' => 'Business',
               'Blon' => 'Slave',
               'Stro' => 'Master',
               'Wert' => 'Father',
               'Onnn' => 'Mother' },
             { 'ree'  => 'AM',
               'plo'  => 'PM' }
           ]

           # A method to determine what a
           # certain name of his means.
           def name_significance
             parts = self.split( '-' )
             syllables = @@syllables.dup
             signif = parts.collect do |p|
               syllables.shift[p]
             end
             signif.join( ' ' )
           end

         end
        </pre>


        Now I've gone beyond just showing you sloppy code.  Here be a grave debauchery and a crime
        against nature.  A crime most languages won't allow you to commit.  We're changing the
        @String@, *one of the core classes of Ruby*!


        "I know this is a bit dangerous," I said, when I passed this one under Paij-ree's nose.
        "I hope nobody gets hurt."


        "Every Smotchkkiss must taste what this (kep-yo-iko) danger does," he said.  "Dogs and logs
        and swampy bogs (kul-ip), all must be tasted."  And he took a swig of his Beagle Berry
        marsh drink.


        So what is it that I'm adding to the @String@ class?  Two things: a class variable and
        a method.  A normal *instance method*.


        I like to look at the *at* symbol as a character meaning *attribute*.  The *double at*
        stands for *attribute all*.  A class variable.  All instances of a class can look at
        this variable and it is the same for all of them.  The @@@syllables@ variable is an
        Array that can now be used inside the String class.


        The new method is @name_significance@ and this new method can be used with any string.


        bq. @print "Paij-ree".name_significance@ prints out @Personal AM@.


        As you can see, Paij-ree is a personal name.  A name friends use in the early hours.


        Make sure you see the line of code which uses @self@.  This is a special variable, a
        variable which represents the object whose method you are calling.  To simplify things
        a bit, let's try making a method which breaks up a string on its dashes.


        <pre>
         class String
           def dash_split
             self.split( '-' )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Again, here's a method which can be used with any string.


        bq. @"Gonk-plo".dash_split@ return the Array @['Gonk', 'plo']@.


        Using @self@ marks the beginning of crossing over into many of the more advanced ideas in Ruby.
        This is definition language.  You're defining a method, designing it before it gets used.  You're
        preparing for the existence of an object which uses that method.  You're saying, "When @dash_split@ 
        gets used, there will be a string at that time which is the one we're dash-splitting.  And @self@ is a 
        special variable which refers to that string."


        Ruby is a knockout definition language.  A succulent and brain-splitting discussion is coming your
        way deeper in this book.


        Most often you won't need to use @self@ explicitly, since you can call methods directly from inside
        other method definitions.


        <pre>
         class String
           def dash_split; split( '-' ); end
         end
        </pre>


        In the @name_significance@ method, find the loop.  Learning about @Array#collect@ is essential.
        Let's look close.


        <pre>
         signif = parts.collect do |p|
           syllables.shift[p]
         end
        </pre>


        The @parts@ Array contains the separated name.  @['Paij', 'plo']@, for instance.  We're iterating
        through each item in that Array with @collect@.  But @collect@ steps beyond what @each@ does.  Like
        @each@, collect slides each item down the chute as a block variable.  And then, at the end of the
        block, @collect@ *keeps the answer the block gives back and adds it to a new Array*.  The @collect@
        method is the perfect way of building a new Array which is based on the items in an existing Array.


        Doug has three cats for sale.  One is twelve cents, one is sixty-three cents, one is nine cents.
        Let's see how much each cat would cost if we added a 20% tip.


        <pre>
         catsandtips = [0.12, 0.63, 0.09].collect { |catcost| catcost + ( catcost * 0.20 ) }
        </pre>


        I say Paij-ree's property is a very charming section of woods when it's not raining cats and Doug.
        For many days, Paij-ree and I camped in tents by the river behind his house, subsisting on smoked
        blackbird and whittling little sleeping indians by the dusklight.  On occassion he would lose
        a game of spades and I knew his mind was distracted, thinking of Endertromb.  All of this
        must have been stirring inside of him for sometime.  I was the first ear he'd ever had.


        "I just came from Ambrose," I said.  "Sort of my own underground home, a place where elves
        strive to perfect animals."


        He mumbled and nodded.  "You can't be (poth-in-oin) part of (in) such things."


        "You think we will fail?"


        "I (preep) have been there before," he said.  And then, he spoke of the Lotteries.

        The elevator had opened into a green room full of shelves and file cabinets. 
        Reels of tape and film canisters and video tape everywhere.  Dr. Cham hadn't
        a clue what most of it was.  All he saw was a big, futuristic mess.


        He called out again, stumbling through alleys of narrow shelves, 
        "Hello-o-o??  I'm looking for intellegent life!  I'm
        a space traveller!"  He tripped when his foot slid right into a VCR slot.
        "Any other beings I can communicate with?"


        Hand cupped around mouth, he yelled, "Hello-o-o?"


        "Crying out loud."  The sleepy goat came tromping down the aisle.

        "I hate that book," said the goat.  "I believe the author is disingenuous."

        "I'm sure it's all true.  It's just so heavily embellished.  I'm like: 
        Enough already.   I get it.  Cut it out."


        "I'm not quite sure what to make of it," said the Doctor.  "It seems like an honest effort.
        I actually wrote something in Ruby back there."


        "It doesn't give goats a very good name," said the goat.

        "And I'm totally misquoted."

        The goat closed his mouth and Dr. Cham held his heart.

        actually tries to kill himself, but Dustin Hoffman sits in the window sill and starts
        crying and singing this totally hilarious heartbreak song.  I've got it here, you
        should see it."


        "Can I get something to eat?" asked the Doctor.  And he still felt filthy.


        "How about we watch a film and you can have a buttermelon with tentacles?" said the goat.


        So, they worked their way back toward the goat's projector.  Back by the freezer locker,
        they sat on a giant rug and broke off the appendages of frozen buttermelons.  The shell
        was solid, but once it cracked, rich fruit cream was in abundance.  Sweet to taste and
        a very pleasant scent.


        "First film, you've got to see," said the goat.  "Locally filmed and produced.  I'm

        Dr. Cham's mind wandered at this point in the presentation, just as the land war
        mounted between the two throngs of animal settlers.  The details of their wars
        and campaigns continued to consume the spool of transparent film that Dr. Cham
        was feeding through the projector.  


        War after war after war.  The Sieging of Elmer Lake.  The Last Stand of Newton P. Giraffe
        and Sons.  Dog Invasion of Little Abandoned Cloud.  No animals died in 
        these wars.  Most often an attack consisted of bopping another
        animal on the head.  And they philipped each other's noses.  But, believe me,
        it was humiliating.


        Blasted crying shame.  Things could have worked out.


        h3. The Birth of an Object


        "Don't worry," said the goat, anxious to sway Dr. Cham's attention back to the film.  "Things _do_
        work out."


        In Ruby, the Object is the very center of all things.  It is The Original.


        <pre>
         class ToastyBear < Object; end
        </pre>


        The angle bracket indicates *inheritance*.  This means that the new @ToastyBear@ class
        is a new class based on the @Object@ class.  Every method that @Object@ has will be
        available in @ToastyBear@.  Constants available in @Object@ will be available in
        @ToastyBear@.


        But every object inherits from @Object@.  The code...


        <pre>
         class ToastyBear; end
        </pre>


        Is identical to...


        <pre>
         class ToastyBear < Object; end
        </pre>


        Inheritance is handy.  You can create species of objects which relate to each other.
        Often, when you're dissecting a problem, you'll come across various objects which share
        attributes.  You can save yourself work by inheriting from classes which already solve
        part of that problem.


        You may have a @UnitedStatesAddress@ class which stores the address, city, state,
        and zip code for someone living in the United States.  When you start storing
        addresses from England, you could add a @UnitedKingdomAddress@ class.  If you then
        ensure that both addresses inherit from a parent @Address@ class, you can design
        your mailing software to accept any kind of address.


        <pre>
         def mail_them_a_kit( address )
           unless address.is_a? Address
             raise ArgumentError, "No Address object found."
           end
           print address.formatted
         end
        </pre>
 

        Also, inheritance is great if you want to override certain behaviours in a class.
        For example, perhaps you want to make your own slight variation to the @Array@ class.
        You want to enhance the @join@ method.  But if you change @Array#join@ directly, you
        will affect other classes in Ruby that use Arrays.


        So you start your own class called @ArrayMine@, which is based on The Original
        @Array@.
        

        <pre>
         class ArrayMine < Array
           # Build a string from this array, formatting each entry
           # then joining them together.
           def join( sep = $,, format = "%s" )
             collect do |item|
               sprintf( format, item )
             end.join( sep )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        @ArrayMine@ is now a custom @Array@ class with its own @join@ method.  @Array@ is
        the *superclass* of @ArrayMine@.  Every object has a @superclass@ method where you
        can verify this relationship.


        <pre>
         irb> ArrayMine.superclass
           => Array
        </pre>


        Perfect.  We manage a hotel and we have an @Array@ of our room sizes: @[3, 4, 6]@.
        Let's get it nicely printed for a brochure.


        <pre>
         rooms = ArrayMine[3, 4, 6]
         print "We have " + rooms.join( ", ", "%d bed" ) + " rooms available."
        </pre>


        Which prints, "We have 3 bed, 4 bed, 6 bed rooms available."


        Dr. Cham was looking around for a bathroom, but archival video tape was everywhere.
        He eventually found a place, it may have been a bathroom.  It had a metal bin.
        More importantly, it was dark and out of eyesight.
        

        While he's in there, let me add that while The Originals slaughtered The Invaders
        to prove their rights as First Creatures, the Ruby Object doesn't have any such
        dispute.  It is the absolute king Object the First.


        Watch.


        <pre>
         irb> Class.superclass
           => Module
         irb> Kernel.class
           => Module
         irb> Module.superclass
           => Object
         irb> Object.superclass
           => nil
        </pre>


        Even @Class@ is an @Object@!  See, although classes are the definition language for objects,
        we still call class methods on them and treat them like objects occassionally.  It may seem
        like a dizzying circle, but it's truly a very strict parentage.  And it ensures that when you
        alter the @Object@, you alter *everything in Ruby*.  Which is impossibly scary and all-powerful
        and cataclysmic and awesome!  *Ruby does not restrict you, my sister, my brother!* 


        Between @Class@ and @Object@, do you see @Module@?  If @Object@ is the king, the one who has
        sired every other part of Ruby, then @Module@ is the poor waifish nun, shielding
        and protecting all her little Ruby townspeople children.  (To complete the analogy:
        @Class@ is the village school teacher and @Kernel@ is the self-important colonel.)


        The whole point of @Module@'s existence is to give food and shelter to code.  Methods
        can stay dry under @Module@'s shawl.  @Module@ can hold classes and constants and 
        variables of any kind.


        "But what does a Module _do_?" you ask.  "How is it gainfully employed??"


        "That's all it does!!" I retort, stretching out my open palms in the greatest expression
        of futility known to man.  "Now hear me -- for I will never speak it again -- that Module Mother
        Superior has given these wretched objects a place to stay!!"


        <pre>
         # See, here is the module -- where else could our code possibly stay?
         module WatchfulSaintAgnes

           # A CONSTANT is laying here by the doorway.  Fine.
           TOOTHLESS_MAN_WITH_FORK = ['man', 'fork', 'exposed gums']

           # A Class is eating, living well in the kitchen.
           class FatWaxyChild; end

           # A Method is hiding back in the banana closet, God knows why.
           def timid_foxfaced_girl; {'please' => 'i want an acorn please'}; end

         end
        </pre>
           
           
        Now you have to go through Saint Agnes to find them.


        <pre>
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes::TOOTHLESS_MAN_WITH_FORK
         => ["man", "fork", "exposed gums"]
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes::FatWaxyChild.new
         => #<WatchfulSaintAgnes::FatWaxyChild:0xb7d2ad78>
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes::instance_methods
         => ["timid_foxfaced_girl"]
        </pre>


        Always remember that a @Module@ is only an inn.  A roof over their heads.  It is not
        a self-aware @Class@ and, therefore, cannot be brought to life with @new@.


        <pre>
         >> WatchfulSaintAgnes.new
         NoMethodError: undefined method `new' for WatchfulSaintAgnes:Module
                 from (irb):2
        </pre>


        St. Agnes has given up her whole life in order that she may care for these desperate bits of code.
        Please.  Don't take that away from her.


        If you wanted to steal from St. Agnes, though, I can help you.
        You can bring in a larger abbey to swallow up the ministry of @WatchfulSaintAgnes@ and then
        what is she left with?


        For this you can use @extend@, which will pull all the methods from a module into a class or an object.


        <pre>
         >> class TheTimeWarnerAolCitibankCaringAndLovingFacility; end
         >> TheTimeWarnerAolCitibankCaringAndLovingFacility.extend WatchfulSaintAgnes
         >> TheTimeWarnerAolCitibankCaringAndLovingFacility::instance_methods
         => ["timid_foxfaced_girl"]
        </pre>


        In truth, no one's _stolen_ from @WatchfulSaintAgnes@, only borrowed.  The @timid_foxfaced_girl@
        now has two addresses.


        You gotta admit.  The old abbey can get bought out a zillion times and that little fox-faced
        girl will _still_ be back in the banana closet wanting an acorn!  Too bad we can't feed her.
        She's a method with no arguments.


        When Dr. Cham came out refreshed, the filmstrip was a bit behind.  But the goat hadn't
        noticed, so the Doctor advanced frames until it made some sense.


        !i/filmstrip-2.gif(The goats that told a planet it was ugly.)!


        So the invaders left the planet.


        "This planet _is_ decrepit," said Dr. Cham.  "The castle is nice.  But inside
        it's a disaster."


        "The whole castle look is a projection," said the goat.  "All the flowers
        and apple blossoms and the sky even.  It's a low-resolution projection."


        "Yes?  It is enchanting."


        "I guess."


        !i/filmstrip-3.gif(The spool ends.)!


        "That's messed up!" said the goat.  "That's not the way the film ends!
        There's no blood!  What happened?  What happened?  Did you screw up the knob, idiot?"


        "Well, I don't know," said Dr. Cham.  He turned the knob reverse and forward.
        Tapped the lens.


        "Check the film!  Check the film!"


        Dr. Cham pulled out a length of film from the projection feed, melted and dripping
        from its end.


        "Curse that!  These projectors are quality!  I've never had this happen.  There's
        no way."


        h3. Hunting For a Voice


        "I don't think it was the projector," said Dr. Cham.  "Something flew across that screen
        and uttered a blistering moan."


        "I don't have any dupes of that movie," said the goat somberly.  "And that girl.  That casting
        director.  I never see her anymore."


        Dr. Cham stood up and looked over the dumpy aisles of magnetic carnage, searching.


        "Oh, hey, you should call that girl," the goat went on. "You could talk to her, get an understanding.
        Tell her about me.  Don't act like your my friend, just, you know, 'Oh, that guy?
        Yeah, whatta maroon.'"


        Dr. Cham spotted the doorway and exited.


        The hallways were an entirely new world of mess.  In the goat's archives, the shelves had been messy.
        In the hallway, shelves were completely tipped.  Sinks were falling through the ceiling.  
        The Doctor ventured under the debris, kicking through plywood when necessary.


        "You shouldn't be out here," said the goat.  "You're on someone else's property at this point.
        A couple of pygmy elephants own all this.  They're nasty guys.  They'll beat the crap outta you
        with their trunks.  They ball it up and just whack ya."


        Dr. Cham pushed a file cabinet out of his way, which fell through a flimsy wall, then through
        the floor of the next room over.  And they heard it fall through several floors after that.


        "I'm trying to remember how it goes in the book," said Dr. Cham, as he walked swiftly through
        the hall.  "That milky fog that swept
        across the projection.  We find that thing."  He jiggled a door handle, broke it off.  Forged
        through the doorway and disappeared inside.


        "You really get a kick out of beating stuff up, don't you?" said the goat.  "Walls, doors."
        The goat headbutted a wall.  The wall shuddered and then laid still.


        Then, it was quiet.  And black.


        The goat stayed put in the bleak hallway, expecting Dr. Cham to flip over a few desks and emerge,
        ready to move on from the room he'd busted into.  But Dr. Cham didn't return, and the goat opted
        to share a moment with the neglected wreckage left by his neighbors.  Not that he could see at all.
        He could only hear the occassional rustling of the piles of invoices and carbon copy masters and
        manila envelopes when he shifted his legs.


        The ground seemed to buckling right under the goat, as if the heaps of kipple around him were
        beginning to slide toward his weight.  He would be at the center of this whirlpool of elephant
        documentation.  Would he die of papercuts first?  Or would he suffocate under the solid burial
        by office supplies?


        A soft light, however, crept up to him.  A floating, silver fish.  No, it was a -- was it scissors?
        The scissors grew into a shimmering cluster of intellegent bread, each slice choking on glitter.
        But, no, it was hands.  And an Easter hat.


        !i/hannah-1.gif(The goat alone in the hallway, meets an apparition.)!


        In another room, Dr. Cham stood under the clear glass silently.  The ceiling had abruptly
        gone transparent, then starlight washed over his pants and jacket.  He walked further to
        the room's center in muted colors, lit as softly as an ancient manuscript in its own box at
        the museum.  More stars, more cotton clusters of fire, unveiled as he came across the floor.
        And it peeked into view soon enough, he expected it to be larger, but it wasn't.


        Earth.  Like a painted egg, still fresh.  He felt long cello strings sing right up
        against his spine.  How could that be called Peoplemud?  Here was a vibrant and grassy
        lightbulb.  The one big ball that had something going for it.


        He thought of The Rockettes.  Actually, he missed The Rockettes.  What a bunch of
        great dancers.  He had yelled something to The Rockettes when he saw them.  Something
        very observant and flattering.


        Oh, yes, while The Rockettes were spinning, arm in arm, he had yelled, "Concentric circles!"
        Which no one else cared to observe. 
        

        And this thought was enough to feed Dr. Cham's superiority complex.  He wore a goofy
        smile as he retraced his footsteps.  He truthfully felt his genius coming through in
        such a statement.  To realize the simplicity of a circle was his.  He reflected on it
        all the way back to the hallway.


        Which I think is great.  Adore yourself when you have a second.

 
        !i/hannah-2.gif(The Doctor knows this ghost.)!


        "Oh, right," said the goat.  "Your niece.  The niece you killed.  I'm with ya now."


        For just a few moments, they all looked at each other.  Just enough
        time for both Dr. Cham and the goat to think: _Oh, yeah.  Hannah
        causes us a lot of trouble.  She's already talking about maple donuts._


        "Does she start talking about maple donuts right away like that?"
        asked the goat.


        "Yes, she does," said the Doctor.  "She brings it up to you, then
        she brings it up to me.  She sees a maple donut somewhere -- I don't
        quite remember where."


        "Do I see a real maple donut?" Hannah said.  "I need a real one."


        "Okay, okay," said the goat.  "Yeah, I remember: here's where she says
        that if she gets a real maple donut, she'll become a real person again.
        Because her real destiny was to own a bakery and you ruined that destiny
        and now she's trapped as a ghost."


        "Hey, that's the truth!" Hannah yelped.


        "It's terrible that we must bear through this whole scene again," said
        the Doctor.  "The donuts are immaterial.  They should be left out altogether."


        "Man, I am having a _hard_ time remembering all of this chapter," said
        the goat.  "I don't even remember how to get out of this hallway.  I must
        have read that book like thirty times.  Do we blast through a wall?   Do
        we scream until someone finds us?"


        "We get Hannah to float through walls and she finds some kind of machine,"
        says Dr. Cham.  "I have to write a program -- it all works out somehow."


        "But, you know what I'm saying?" said the goat.  "I forget all the details.
        Especially the earlier chapters.  I mean I can remember the ending perfectly.
        It's hard to sit through all this.  The end is so much better."


        Dr. Cham folded his arms and teetered on a heel.  "The porcupine."  He
        smiled greedily at the goat.


        "Oh, totally.  The porcupine is definitely who I want to meet," said the
        goat.  "I wonder what he does with all that money when the book is over."


        Dr. Cham nodded respectfully.  "I'm very excited to see him wearing slippers."


        "Those infernal slippers!" said the goat and he haw-hawed coarsely, a shower
        of saliva cascading from his jaws.


        Hannah's mind rattled, waiting for this nonsense to break for a moment.
        She tipped her head on its side and the rattle slid along the curve of
        her cranium.  The little noise died away, though, as the back of her head
        vanished (_fluxed out_ is what she called it) and then her head was  
        back again with its little rattle and she caught herself doing that
        careless moaning again.  *HRRRRRR-RRR-OH-RRRR-RRRR.*


        "I'm not as into the chunky bacon stuff," said the goat.  "I don't see
        what's so great about it."


        Could she speak while moaning? *BON-BON.*  With a French moan.  *BOHN-BOHN.
        BOHN-APPE-TEET-OHHHH-RRRR.*


        "I know she's harmless, but that sound freaks me out.  My hair is
        *completely* on end."


        "Hannah?" said Dr. Cham.  "Where are you, child?  Come do a good turn
        for us, my niece."


        She was right near them, in and out.  And they could hear her
        cleaning up her voice, bright, speaking like a angel scattering stardust.
        Yes, the whole maple donut story came out again, and more about the
        bakery she would own, the muffins and rolls and baguettes.


    - The Theft of the Lottery Captain: >


        !>i/my.daughters.organ-3.gif(The piping and mixtures of the lotteries.)!


        And now, Paij-ree's stories of the Lotteries.


        On Endertromb, the organist's father invented the lottery.  The idea came while
        he was praying to Digger Dosh.


        Digger Dosh is sort of like their God.  But ten times scarier.  This
        guy dug an infinitely deep tunnel straight through the planet and came out dead.
        But he's really not dead.  He's really just _one second_ behind them.  And he eats time.


        It's kind of complicated because Digger Dosh totally kills people.  But I guess if 
        you do what he says, it's not so bad.  Maybe I'll talk about it later.  It's such a
        pain to talk about because it's so scary and yet one of my friends actually believes
        the whole thing.  I get kind of choked up -- not like I'm crying, more like I'm choking.


        Anyway, once while praying, three numbers came to Paij-ree's father.


        He then asked his mind, "What are these numbers?"


        And his mind played a short video clip of him selling all kinds of numbers.  And, for
        years and years, travelling and selling numbers.


        And he asked his brain, "People will buy numbers?"


        And his brain said, "If they buy the right three numbers, give them a prize."


        At which he imagined himself launching off a ski jump and showering people with
        presents.  No question: he would be an icon.


        So he went and did as his brain said and sold numbers.  The father's simple lottery
        consisted of three unique numbers, drawn from a set of 25 numbers.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket

           NUMERIC_RANGE = 1..25

           attr_reader :picks, :purchased

           def initialize( *picks )
             if picks.length != 3
               raise ArgumentError, "three numbers must be picked"
             elsif picks.uniq.length != 3
               raise ArgumentError, "the three picks must be different numbers"
             elsif picks.detect { |p| not NUMERIC_RANGE === p }
               raise ArgumentError, "the three picks must be numbers between 1 and 25."
             end
             @picks = picks
             @purchased = Time.now
           end

         end
        </pre>


        Yes, the @LotteryTicket@ class contained the three numbers (@@picks@) and the
        time when the ticket was bought (@@purchased@).  The allowed range of numbers
        (from *one* to *twenty-five*) is kept in the constant @NUMERIC_RANGE@.


        The @initialize@ method here can have any number of arguments passed in.  The
        *asterisk* in the @picks@ argument means that *any arguments will be passed
        in as an Array*.  Having the arguments in an Array means that methods like
        @uniq@ and @detect@ can be used on the arguments together.


        This class contains two definitions: the method definition (@def@) and
        an attributes definition (@attr_reader@).  Both are *really just method definitions*
        though.


        The @attr_reader@ shortcut is identical to writing this Ruby code:


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def picks; @picks; end
           def purchased; @purchased; end
         end
        </pre>


        Attributes are wrapper methods for instance variables (such as @@picks@) which can be used
        *outside of the class itself*.  Paij-ree's father wanted to code a machine which
        could read the numbers and the date of purchase from the ticket.  In order to do that,
        those instance variables must be exposed.


        Let's create a random ticket and read back the numbers:


        <pre>
         ticket = LotteryTicket.new( rand( 25 ) + 1,
                     rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1 )
         p ticket.picks
        </pre>


        Running the above, I just got: @[23, 14, 20]@.  You will get an error if two of
        the random numbers happen to be identical.


        However, I can't change the lottery ticket's picks from outside of the class.


        <pre>
         ticket.picks = [2, 6, 19]
        </pre>


        I get an error: @undefined method `picks='@.
        This is because @attr_reader@ only adds a *reader* method, not a writer method.
        That's fine, though.  We don't want the numbers or the date to change.


        So, the tickets are _objects_.  Instances of the @LotteryTicket@ class.  Make a
        ticket with @LotteryTicket.new@.  Each ticket has it's own @@picks@ and it's own
        @@purchased@ instance variables.


        The lottery captain would need to draw three random numbers at the close
        of the lottery, so we'll add a convenient class method for generating random
        tickets.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def self.new_random
             new( rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1 )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Oh, no.  But we have that stupid error that pops up if two of the random numbers
        happen to be identical.  If two numbers are the same, the @initialize@ throws
        an @ArgumentError@.


        The trick is going to be restarting the method if an error happens.
        We can use Ruby's @rescue@ to handle the error and @redo@ to start the method
        over.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def self.new_random
             new( rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1, rand( 25 ) + 1 )
           rescue ArgumentError
             redo
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Better.  It may take a couple times for the numbers to fall together right,
        but it'll happen.  The wait will build suspense, huh?


        The lottery captain kept a roster of everyone who bought tickets, along
        with the numbers they drew.


        <pre>
         class LotteryDraw
           @@tickets = {}
           def LotteryDraw.buy( customer, *tickets )
             unless @@tickets.has_key?( customer )
               @@tickets[customer] = []
             end
             @@tickets[customer] += tickets
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Yal-dal-rip-sip was the first customer.


        <pre>
         LotteryDraw.buy 'Yal-dal-rip-sip',
             LotteryTicket.new( 12, 6, 19 ),
             LotteryTicket.new( 5, 1, 3 ),
             LotteryTicket.new( 24, 6, 8 )
        </pre>


        When it came time for the lottery draw, Paij-ree's father (the lottery captain) added
        a bit of code to randomly select the numbers.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def score( final )
             count = 0
             final.picks.each do |note|
               count +=1 if picks.include? note
             end
             count
           end
         end
        </pre>


        The @score@ method compares a @LotteryTicket@ against a random ticket,
        which represents the winning combination.  The random ticket is passed in
        through the @final@ variable.  The ticket gets one point for every winning
        number.  The point total is returned from the @score@ method.


        <pre>
         irb> ticket = LotteryTicket.new( 2, 5, 19 )
         irb> winner = LotteryTicket.new( 4, 5, 19 )
         irb> ticket.score( winner )
           => 2
        </pre>


        You will see how brilliant Paij-ree is, in time.  His father commissioned him
        to finish the lottery for him, while the demand for tickets consumed the
        lottery captain's daylight hours.  Can't you just imagine young Paij-ree in his stuffy
        suit, snapping a rubber band in his young thumbs at the company meetings where he proposed the
        final piece of the system?  Sure, when he stood up, his dad did all the talking for
        him, but he flipped on the projector and performed all the hand motions.

 
        <pre>
         class << LotteryDraw
           def play
             final = LotteryTicket.new_random
             winners = {}
             @@tickets.each do |buyer, ticket_list|
               ticket_list.each do |ticket|
                 score = ticket.score( final )
                 next if score.zero?
                 winners[buyer] ||= []
                 winners[buyer] << [ ticket, score ]
               end
             end
             @@tickets.clear
             winners
           end
         end
        </pre>


        His father's associates were stunned.  What was this?  (Paij-ree knew this
        was just another class method definition -- they would all feel completely
        demoralized when he told them so.)  They couldn't understand the *double
        angle bracket* up there!  Yes, it was a concatenator, but how is it in
        the class title?


        _Infants_, thought Paij-ree, although he held everyone of those men in very
        high esteem.  He was just a kid and kids are tough as a brick's teeth. 


        The @<<@ operator allows you to alter the definition of an object.
        Had Paij-ree simply used @class LotteryDraw@, his @play@ method would be
        a normal instance method.  But since he used the @<<@ operator, the @play@
        method will be added directly to the class, as a class method.  


        When you see @class << obj@, believe in your heart, _I'm adding directly to the definition
        of @obj@._


        The budding organ instructor also threw in a tricky syntax worth examining.
        In the ninth line, a winner has been found.


        <pre>
         winners[buyer] ||= []
         winners[buyer] << [ ticket, score ]
        </pre>


        The @||=@ syntax is a shortcut.


        <pre>
         winners[buyer] = winners[buyer] || []
        </pre>


        The *double pipe* is an *or* logic.  Set @winners[buyer]@ equal to @winners[buyer]@ or,
        if @winners[buyer]@ is nil, set it to @[]@.  This shortcut is a little strange, but if you
        can really plant it in your head, it's a nice timesaver.  You're just making sure a variable
        is set before using it.


        <pre>
         irb> LotteryDraw.play.each do |winner, tickets|
         irb>   puts winner + "won on " + tickets.length + " ticket(s)!"
         irb>   tickets.each do |ticket, score|
         irb>     puts "\t" + ticket.picks.join( ', ' ) + ": " + score
         irb>   end
         irb> end

         Gram-yol won on 2 ticket(s)!
             25, 14, 33: 1
             12, 11, 29: 1
         Tarker-azain won on 1 ticket(s)!
             13, 15, 29: 2
         Bramlor-exxon won on 1 ticket(s)!
             2, 6, 14: 1
        </pre>


        But these salad days were not to continue for Paij-ree and his father.  His father often
        neglected to launder his uniform and contracted a moss disease on his shoulders.  The disease
        gradually stole his equilibrium and his sense of direction.


        His father still futilely attempted to keep the business running.  He spiraled through the
        city, sometimes tumbling leg-over-leg down the cobbled stone, most often slowly feeling the walls,
        counting bricks to the math parlours and coachmen stations, where he would thrust tickets
        at the bystanders, who hounded him and slapped him away with long, wet beets.  Later, Paij-ree
        would find him in a corner, his blood running into the city drains alongside the juices of the
        dark, splattered beets, which juice weaseled its way up into his veins and stung and clotted
        and glowed fiercely like a congested army of brake lights fighting their way through toll bridges.


        h3. A Word About Accessors (Because I Love You and I Hope For Your Success and My Hair is On End
        About This and Dreams Really Do Come True)
        

        Earlier, I mentioned that @attr_reader@ adds *reader* methods, but not *writer* methods.


        <pre>
         irb> ticket = LotteryTicket.new
         irb> ticket.picks = 3
         NoMethodError: undefined method `picks=' for #<LotteryTicket:0xb7d49110>
        </pre>


        Which is okay in this case, since Paij-ree's father didn't want the numbers to be
        changed after the ticket was bought.  If we were interested in having instance
        variables which had *both readers and writers*, we would use @attr_accessor@.


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           attr_accessor :picks, :purchased
         end
        </pre>


        Which is exactly the same as this lengthier code:


        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           def picks;           @picks;            end
           def picks=(var);     @picks = var;      end
           def purchased;       @purchased;        end
           def purchased=(var); @purchased = var;  end
         end
        </pre>


        Holy cats!  Look at those writer methods for a moment.  They are the methods named
        @picks=@ and @purchased=@.  These methods *intercept outside assignment* to instance variables.
        Usually you will just let @attr_reader@ or @attr_accessor@ (or even perhaps @attr_writer@)
        do the work for you.
        Other times you may want to put a guard at the door yourself, checking variables in closer
        detail.


        <pre>
         class SkatingContest
           def the_winner; @the_winner; end
           def the_winner=( name )
             unless name.respond_to? :to_str
               raise ArgumentError, "The winner's name must be a String,
                 not a math problem or a list of names or any of that business."
             end
             @the_winner = name
           end
         end
        </pre>


        Most of the time you won't use this.  But, as we move along through your lessons, you'll find that
        Ruby has lots of escape hatches and alley ways you can sneak into and hack code into.  I'm also
        preparing you for metaprogramming, which, if you can smell that dragon, is ominously near.

      Another Excerpt from The Scarf Eaters: >

        (_from Chapter VIII: Sky High_.)


        "I know you," said Brent.  "And I know your timelines.
        You couldn't have done this Flash piece."


        "So, you're saying I'm predictable?" said Deborah.  She
        opened her hands and the diced potatoes stumbled like little,
        drunk sea otters happily into the open crockpot.


        "You're very linear," said Brent.  He took up a mechanical pencil,
        held it straight before his eyes, gazing tightly at it before
        replacing it in the pencil holder on the counter.  "Do you
        even know how to load a scene?  How to jump frames?  This
        movie I saw was all over the place, Deb."


        She heaped five knit scarves and a single bandana into the slow
        cooker and set it on high.  She closed the lid, leaving her hand
        resting upon it.


        "What is it about this movie?"  Deborah asked.  "You go to
        Flash sites all the time.  You played the Elf Snowball game
        for two seconds, it didn't interest you.  You didn't care for
        Elf Bowling games even.  And you weren't even phased by that
        Hit The Penguin flash game.  Elf versus Penguin?  Don't even
        ask!


        "Now this movie comes along and you can't get a grip."
        She walked over and siddled up next to him.  "Yo, bro, it's me.
        Deborah.  What happened when you saw that movie?"


        "Everything," said Brent, his eyes reflecting a million worlds.
        "And: nothing.  It opened with a young girl riding upon a wild
        boar.  She was playing harmonica.  The harmonica music washed in
        and out, uneasy, unsure.  But she rode naturally, as if it wasn't
        anything of a big deal to ride a wild boar.  And with
        Flash, riding a wild boar really isn't a big deal."


        Deborah unclasped her bracelet and set it on the counter by the
        crockpot.


        "The bottom of the movie started to break up, an ink puddle formed.
        The boar reared up, but his legs gave way to the all the dark,
        sputtering ink."


        "Dark clouds converged.  Hardcore music started to play.  Secret
        agents came out of the clouds.  CIA guys and stuff.  The animation
        simply rocked.


        "And then, at the very end of the movie, these words fade upon the
        screen.  In white, bold letters."


        "Sky high," said Deborah.


        "How did you know?" Brent's lip quivered.  Could she be trusted?


        "There is no room left in the world," she said.  "No room for Scarf Eaters,
        no room for you and I.  Here, take my hand."

        Paij-ree was an enterprising young Endertromaltoek.  He hammered animal bones into long,
        glistening trumpets with deep holes that were plugged by corks the musicians banded to
        their fingers.  Sure, he only sold three of those units, but he was widely reviled as
        a freelance scholar, a demonic one, for he was of a poorer class and the poor only
        ever acquired their brilliance through satanic practice.  Of course, they were right,
        indeed, he did have a bargain with the dark mages, whom he kept appointments with annually,
        enduring torturous hot springs, bathing as they chanted spells.


        He adored his father, even as his father deteriorated into but a gyroscope.  He idolized the
        man's work and spent his own small earnings playing the lottery.  He loved to watch the
        numerals, each painted upon hollow clay balls, rise in the _robloch_ (which is any fluid,
        pond or spill that has happened to withstand the presence of ghosts), the great bankers
        tying them together on a silver string, reading them in order.


        Even today, Paij-ree paints the scenes with crude strokes of black ink on sheets of aluminum 
        foil.  It is very touching to see him caught up in the preciousness of his memory, but I don't 
        know exactly why he does it on aluminum foil.  His drawings rip too easily.  Paij-ree himself
        gets mixed up and will serve you crumbcake right off of some of this art, even after it has
        been properly framed.  So many things about him are troubling and absurd and downright wretched.


        The disease spread over his father's form and marshy weeds covered his father's hands
        and face.  The moss pulled his spine up into a rigid uprightness.  So thick was the
        growth over his head that he appeared to wear a shrub molded into a bowler's hat.  He
        also called himself by a new name -- *Quos* -- and he healed the people he touched, leaving
        a pile of full-blooded, greenly-cheeked villages in his wake as he travelled the
        townships.  Many called him The Mossiah and wept on his feet, which wet the buds and caused
        him to weed into the ground.  This made him momentarily angry, he harshly jogged his legs
        to break free and thrashed his fists wildly in the sky, bringing down a storm of lightning
        shards upon these pitiful.


        Paij-ree was apart from the spiritual odysseys of his father (in fact, thought the man
        dead), so he only saw the decay of the lottery without its captain present.  Here is
        where Paij-ree went to work, reviving the dead lottery of his family.


        h3. Gambling with Fewer Fingers


        The city was crowded with people who had lost interest in the lottery.  The weather
        had really worn everyone down as well.  Such terrible rain flooding their cellars.
        The entire city was forced to move up one story.  You'd go to put the cap back on your
        pen and you'd ruin the pen, since the cap was already full of slosh.  Everyone was depleted,
        many people drowned.


        Paij-ree found himself wasting his days in a quadruple bunkbed, the only furniture that
        managed to stay above sea level.  He slept on the top bed.  The third bed up was dry as
        well, so he let a homeless crater gull nest upon it.  The gull didn't need the whole bed,
        so Paij-ree also kept his calculators and pencils down there.


        At first, these were very dark times for both of them, and they insisted on remaining
        haggard at all times.  Paij-ree became obsessed with his fingernails, kept them long and
        pristine, while the rest of him deteriorated under a suit of hair.  In the company of
        Paij-ree, the crater gull learned his own eccentrity and plucked all the feathers on
        the right side of his body.  He looked like a cutaway diagram.


        They learned to have happier times.  Paij-ree carved a flute from the wall with his nails and played
        it often.  Mostly he played his relaxed ballads during the daytime.  In the evening,
        they pounded the wall and shook the bed frame in time to his songs.  The gull went
        nuts when he played a certain four notes and he looped this section repeatedly,
        watching the gull swoop and circle in ectasy.  Paij-ree could hardly keep his
        composure over the effect the little tune had and he couldn't keep it together,
        fell all apart, slobbering and horse-giggling.


        Paij-ree called the gull _Eb-F-F-A_, after that favorite song.


        Friendship can be a very good catalyst for progress.  A friend can find traits in you
        that no one else can.  It's like they searched your person and somehow came up
        with five full sets of silverware you never knew were there.  And even though
        that friend may not understand why you had these utensils concealed, it's still a
        great feat, worth honoring.


        While _Eb-F-F-A_ didn't find silverware, he did find something else.  A
        pile of something else.  Since Paij-ree was stranded on the quadruple bed, the gull
        would scout around for food.  One day, he flew down upon a barrel, floating over where
        the toolshed had been.  _Eb-F-F-A_ walked on top of the barrel, spinning it back to Paij-ree's
        house and they cracked it open, revealing Paij-ree's lost collection of duck bills.


        Yes, real duck bills. (_Eb-F-F-A_ was esophagizing his squawks, remaining calm,
        sucking beads of sweat back into his forehead -- ducks were not _of his chosen feather_,
        but still in the species.)  Paij-ree clapped gleefully, absolutely, he had intended
        to shingle his house with these, they could have deflected a bit of the torrent.
        Probably not much, nothing to cry about.


        And the roof glue was at the barrel's bottom and they were two enterprising
        bunkmates with time to kill, so they made a raft from the previously-quacked
        lip shades.  And off they were to the country!  Stirring through a real mess of
        city and soup.  How strange it was to hit a beach and find out it was just the old
        dirt road passed Toffletown Junction.


        In the country, they sold.  It was always a long walk to the next plantation,
        but there would be a few buyers up in the mansion ("Welcome to The Mansion Built on Beets",
        they'd say or, "The Mansion Built on Cellophane Substitutes -- don't you know how
        harmful real cellophane can be?")  And one of the families wrapped up some excess
        jelly and ham in some cellophane for the two travellers.  And they almost died one day later
        because of it.
        

        Then, when the heat came and, as the first countryside lottery was at nigh,
        a farmer called to them from his field, as he stood by his grazing cow.
        Paij-ree and _Eb-F-F-A_ wandered out to him, murmuring to each other as to
        whether they should offer him the Wind-Beaten Ticket Special or whether he
        might want to opt in to winning Risky Rosco's Original Homestyle Country 
        Medallion.


        But the farmer waved them down as he approached, "No, put your calculators and probability
        wheels away.  It's for my grazledon."  He meant his cow.  The Endertromb version:
        twice as much flesh, twice as meaty, doesn't produce milk, produces paper plates.  Still,
        it grazes.


        "Your grazledon (poh-kon-ic) wants a lucky ticket?" asked Paij-ree.


        "He saw you two and got real excited," said the farmer.  "He doesn't know numbers,
        but he understands luck a bit.  He almost got hit by a doter plane one day and, when
        I found him, he just gave shrug.  It was like he said, 'Well, I guess that worked out
        okay.'"


        "The whole (shas-op) lottery is numer-(ig-ig)-ic," said Paij-ree.  "Does he know
        (elsh) notes?  My eagle knows (losh) notes."  Paij-ree whistled at the crater gull,
        who cooed back a sustained _D_.


        The farmer couldn't speak to his grazledon's tonal awareness, so Paij-ree sent the gull
        to find out (_D-D-D-A-D_, _go-teach-the-gra-zle_) while he hacked some notes into
        his calculator.


        <pre>
         class AnimalLottoTicket

             end

             new( NOTES[ rand( NOTES.length ) ], NOTES[ rand( NOTES.length ) ],
                  NOTES[ rand( NOTES.length ) ] )
           rescue ArgumentError
             redo
           end

         end
        </pre>


        No need for the animal's tickets to behave drastically different from the traditional
        tickets.  The @AnimalLottoTicket@ class is internally different, but exposes the same
        methods seen in the original @LotteryTicket@ class.
        The @score@ method is even identical to the @score@ method from the old @LotteryTicket@
        class.


        Instead of using a class variable to store the musical note list, they're stored in
        a constant called @AnimalLottoTicket::NOTES@.  Variables change and the note list
        shouldn't change.  Constants are designed to stay the same.  You can still change the
        constant, but you'll have to be tricky or Ruby will speak up.


        <pre>
         irb> AnimalLottoTicket::NOTES = [:TOOT, :TWEET, :BLAT]
         (irb):3: warning: already initialized constant NOTES
           => [:TOOT, :TWEET, :BLAT]
        </pre>


        The gull came back with the grazledon, his name was Merphy, he was thrilled to play chance,
        he puffed his face dreamily, whistled five and six notes
        in series, they all held his collar, pulled him close to the calculator and let him breathe
        three notes, then they choked the bedosh outta him until his ticket was printed and 
        everything was nicely catalogued inside @@@tickets['merphy']@.  Thankyou, see ya at the draw!


        So, the fever of the lottery became an epidemic among the simple minds of the animals.  
        Paij-ree saved his costs, used the same @LotteryDraw@ class he'd used in the corporate environment of
        the lottery from his childhood.  And soon enough, the animals were making their own
        music and their own maps and films.


        "What about The Originals?" I asked Paij-ree.  "They must have hated your animals!"


        But he winced sourly and pinched his forehead.  "I am an Original.  You as well.
        Do we (ae-o) hate any of them?"


        Not too long after the lottery ended, Paij-ree felt the crater gull _Eb-F-F-A_
        lighting upon his shoulder, which whistled an urgent and sad _C-Eb-D C-A-Eb_.
        These desparate notes sent an organ roll of chills straight through Paij-ree.  Had the
        King God of Potted Soil, Our Beloved Topiary, *the Mossiah Quos*, Literal Father of
        That Man Who Would Be My Daughter's Organ Instructor -- had he truly come to his end?
        How could this be?  Could the great arbors no longer nourish him and guide the moist crosswinds
        to him?  Or did his own spindly lichen hedge up his way and grow against his breathing?


        _You never mind_, went the tune of the gull.  _He has detoriated and weakened and fallen in the
        lit door of your home cottage.  His tendrils needing and crying for the day to not end.
        For the sun to stay fixed and wide and attentive._


        Plor-ian, the house attendant, kept the pitchers coming and Quos stayed well watered
        until Paij-ree arrived to survey the decaying buds of soft plant and the emerging face of
        his father, the lottery captain.  His skin deeply pocked like an overly embroidered pillow.
        Great shoots springing from his sleeves now curled back with lurching thirst.


        Paij-ree combed back the longer stems around his father's eyes and those coming from the
        corners of his mouth.  While I'd like to tell you that Paij-ree's tears rolled down
        his sleeves and into the pours of his father, rejuvenating and restoring the grassy gentleman:
        I cannot say this.


        Rather, Paij-ree's tears rolled down his sleeves and into the creaking clapboard floor,
        nourishing the vile weeds, energizing the dark plant matter, which literally lept through
        the floor at night and strangled Our Quos.  Yank, pull, crack.  And that was his skull.


        So Paij-ree could never be called Wert-ree or Wert-plo after that.


    - Them What Make the Rules: >

        Hannah lept back from the wall and clenched down on her fingers.


        "This is the wall," said Dr. Cham.  "The Originals are in there.  My child, can you
        lead us to the observation deck?"


        "You expect us to go up against those guys?" asked the goat.  "They're mad as koalas.  But these
        koalas have lasers!"


        "We prevail, though," said Dr. Cham.  "You and I know this."


        "Okay, well I'm muddled on that point," said the goat.  "Do we really win?
        Or could we be thinking about _Kramer vs. Kramer_?  Does Dustin Hoffman win or do we win?"


        "No.  No.  No.  No."  Hannah hovered and dragged her legs along the wall nervously.
        "There is a man with a huge face in there!"


        "Mr. Face," said the Doctor.  "He is the original face."


        "He didn't see me," said Hannah and moaned.  *HOMA-HOMA-ALLO-ALLO.*


        She made that hollow weeping through the crumbling mouseholes and the freezer gateways,
        fluxing in and out, causing the video checkpoints to hiss and the wall panels to
        brace themselves and fall silent.  The three passed through two levels of frayed security
        and emerged in the observation deck overlooking the cargo bay.


        !i/the.originals-1.jpg(Klon Ooper. Corwood. Mr. Face. Vonblisser.  The Originals.)!


        "The last living among The Originals," said Dr. Cham.  "Are you alright with this,
        Hannah?"  Which she didn't hear in any way, as her eyes laid fixed on the legendary
        creatures.


        "Look at them," said the goat.  "These guys wrote the rule books, Doctor.  We owe
        everything to these guys."


        "What about God?" said Dr. Cham.

        
        "I don't really know," said the goat.  "Hannah probably knows better than any of us
        about that."


        Hannah said nothing.  She only really knew one other ghost and that was her Post-Decease Mediator,
        Jamie Huft.  Who didn't seem to have any answers for her and required questions to be submitted
        in writing with a self-addressed stamped envelope included.  Hannah hadn't gotten the ball rolling
        on that P.O. Box yet.


        "We must be up in the mountains," said the goat.  "Look out at that blackness."


        "I saw another deck like this down by where we found Hannah," said Dr. Cham.  "Down closer
        to your living area.  You should take time to search for it.  It's very peaceful there.
        You can see Earth and the seven seas."


        "The seven seas?"  The goat wondered if that was near The Rockettes.  He'd read his share
        of material on precision dancing and he'd seen that line of legs, mincing across the
        stage like a big, glitsy rototiller.
        

        Hannah stirred to life.


        !i/the.originals-2.jpg(Hannah panicks. Maple donuts are within reach.)!


        !i/the.originals-3.jpg(They couldn't hear them, but they saw their slides.)!


        And none of the three spoke when The Originals flicked off the slide projector
        and boarded a very slender rocketship and cleanly exploded through a crevice in the
        cargo bay roof.


        "Oh, boy," said the goat.


        "What?" said Hannah.


        "You're going to die," said the goat.


        Dr. Cham looked over the controls in front of them, a long panel of padded handles and
        green screens.


        "I'm already dead.  I'm a ghost."


        The goat looked down at the Doctor, who was rummaging under the control panel.  "Okay, well
        if your uncle isn't going to have a talk with you, I'm going to make things very clear.  There's
        a good chance these guys are going to build a bomb.  And you see how I'm fidgeting?  You see
        how my knees are wobbling?"


        "Yeah."


        "Yeah, that's how real this is, kid.  I don't remember anything from that _confounded book_ except
        that these guys are building a bomb that can blow up the ghost world.  
        Because once the ghost world's gone, then Digger Dosh gets his one second back.  
        It's a trade they've worked out.  Hell, it's sick stuff, that's all you need to know."


        "But I'm dead."


        "Okay, well, we're talking, aren't we?  You can talk, so are you dead?"  The goat shook his head.
        "I wish I could remember if we win or if it was Dustin Hoffman."


        Hannah cried.  "Why do I have to die again?"  She wailed and her legs fell into
        flux and she sunk into the floor.  *MOH-MOHHH-MAO-MAOOO.*


        Dr. Cham had forceably yanked on a plush handle, which unlocked and slid open like a breadbox.
        He reached his hands inside and found a keyboard firmly bolted deep inside.


        "That's it," he said and pulled up @irb@, which appeared on a display to the left of his
        concealed typing.  He checked the Ruby version.


        <pre>
         irb> RUBY_VERSION
           => "1.8.2"
        </pre>


        Ruby was up-to-date.  What else could he do?  Scanning @constants@ and @class_variables@ was pointless.
        The only reason that had worked with the @Elevator@ class was because someone had left @irb@ running
        with their classes still loaded.


        He had just loaded this @irb@, so no special classes were available yet.  He had to find some classes.
        He started by loading the @`rbconfig`@ file to get an idea of what Ruby's settings were.


        <pre>
         irb> require 'rbconfig'
           => true
         irb> Config::CONFIG
           => {"abs_srcdir"=>"$(ac_abs_srcdir)", "sitedir"=>"bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby", ... }
        </pre>


        Too much information to sort through there.  The @Config::CONFIG@ constant is a Hash that
        contains every environment setting used to setup Ruby.  You can find the operating system
        name at @Config::CONFIG['host_os']@.  The directory where core Ruby libraries are stored
        can be found at @Config::CONFIG['rubylibdir']@.  Ruby programs can store helper files at
        @Config::CONFIG['datadir']@.
        

        What Dr. Cham really needed, though, was a list of all the libraries that aren't core Ruby
        libraries.  Libraries which were installed by The Originals or whoever manned this console.
        He checked a few global variables for this information.


        <pre>
         irb> $"
           => ["irb.rb", "e2mmap.rb", "irb/init.rb", ... "rbconfig.rb"]
         irb> $:
           => ["bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9", "bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/i686-unknown",
               "bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby", "bay://Ruby/lib/1.9", 
               "bay://Ruby/lib/1.9/i686-unknown", "."]
        </pre>


        Aha, good.  Dr. Cham stroked his beard and looked over his @irb@ session.  The @$"@ global variable
        contains an Array of every library which has been loaded with @require@.  Most of these libraries
        had been loaded by @irb@.  He had loaded @'rbconfig.rb'@ earlier, though.


        The @$:@ global variable, which can also be accessed as @$LOAD_PATH@, contains a list of all
        the directories which Ruby will check when you try to load a file with @require@.  When Dr.
        Cham ran @require 'rbconfig'@, Ruby checked each directory in order.


        <pre>
         bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/rbconfig.rb
         bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/i686-unknown/rbconfig.rb (*)
         bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/rbconfig.rb
         bay://Ruby/lib/1.9/rbconfig.rb
         bay://Ruby/lib/1.9/i686-unknown/rbconfig.rb
         ./rbconfig.rb
        </pre>


        The second path was where Ruby ended up finding the rbconfig.rb file.  Dr. Cham guessed that
        the first five paths were *absolute paths*.  These were paths to directories on a drive called
        @bay@.  Absolute paths may vary on your system.  On Windows, absolute paths will start with
        a drive letter.  On Linux, absolute paths start with a slash.


        The directory @"."@ indicates a *relative path*.  The lone period represents the current
        work directory.  The directory where Dr. Cham started up @irb@.  So, after Ruby has searched
        all the standard places, it checks the current directory.


        The goat had peeked his head around Dr. Cham and was watching all these instructions
        transpire, as he licked his lips to keep his salivations from running all over the monitors
        and glossy buttons.  He had been interjecting a few short cheers (along the lines of:
        _No, not that_ or _Yes, yes, right_ or _Okay, well, your choice_), but now he was
        fully involved, recommending code, "Try @require 'setup'@ or, no, try
        @3 * 5@.  Make sure that basic math works."


        "Of course the math works," said Dr. Cham.  "Let me be, I need to find some useful classes."


        "It's a basic sanity test," said the goat.  "Just try it.  Do @3 * 5@ and see what
        comes up."


        Dr. Cham caved.


        <pre>
         irb> 3 * 5
           => 15
        </pre>


        "Okay, great!  We're in business!" the goat tossed his furry face about in glee.
        

        Dr. Cham patted the goat's head, "Well done.  We can continue."


        <pre>
         irb> Dir.chdir( "bay://Ruby/lib/site_ruby/1.9/" )
           => 0
         irb> Dir["./*.{rb}"]
           => ['endertromb.rb', 'mindreader.rb', 'wishmaker.rb']
        </pre>


        Dr. Cham had use @chdir@ to change the current working directory over the the first
        path listed in @$LOAD_PATH@.  This first path in @site_ruby@ is a common place to store
        custom classes.


        Here were the three legendary classes that my daughter's organ instructor had inscribed
        for me earlier in this chapter.  And, Dr. Cham, having read this selfsame chapter, recognized
        these three pieces of the system immediately.


        The @Endertromb@ class which contained the mysteries of this planet's powers.  The @MindReader@
        class which, upon scanning the minds of its inhabitants, read each mind's contents.  And, finally,
        the crucial @WishMaker@ class which powered the granting of ten-letter wishes, should the wish
        ever find its way to the core of Endertromb.


        "How about @4 * 56 + 9@?" asked the goat.  "We don't know if it can do compound expressions."


        "I've got the @MindReader@ right here," said Dr. Cham.  "And I have the @WishMaker@ here next to it.
        This planet can read minds.  And this planet can make wishes.  Now, let's see if it can do both at
        the same time."


    - Them What Live the Dream: >

        While The Originals' craft had long disappeared, Dr. Cham frantically worked away at the
        computer built into the control panel up in the observation deck.  Hannah had disappeared
        into the floor (or perhaps those little sparks along the ground were still wisps of her
        paranormal presence!) and the goat amicably watched Dr. Cham hack out a Ruby module.


        <pre>
         require 'endertromb'
         module WishScanner
           def scan_for_a_wish
             wish = self.read.detect do |thought|
               thought.index( 'wish: ' ) == 0
             end
             wish.gsub( 'wish: ', '' )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        "What's your plan?" asked the goat.  "It seems like I could have solved this problem in
        like three lines."


        "This @Module@ is the new @WishScanner@ technology," he said.  "The scanner only picks up
        a wish if it starts with the word @wish@ and a colon and a space.  That way the planet doesn't
        fill up with every less-than-ten-letter word that appears in people's heads."


        "Why don't you just use a class?" asked the goat.


        "Because a @Module@ is simpler than a class.  It's basically just a storage facility
        for methods.  It keeps a group of methods together.  You can't create new objects
        from a method."


        "But aren't you going to want a @WishScanner@ object, so you can actually use
        it?" said the goat, appalled.


        "I'm going to mix it into the @MindReader@," said Dr. Cham.  And he did.


        <pre>
         require 'mindreader'
         class MindReader
           include MindScanner
         end
        </pre>


        "Now, the @MindScanner@ module is mixed in to the @MindReader@," said Dr. Cham.
        "I can call the @scan_for_a_wish@ method on any @MindReader@ object."


        "So, it's a mixin," said the goat.  "The @MindScanner@ mixin."


        "Yes, any module which is introduced into a class with @include@ is a mixin to that
        class.  If you go back and look at the @scan_for_a_wish@ method, you'll see that it
        calls a @self.read@ method.  I just have to make sure that whatever class I'm mixing
        @MindScanner@ into has a @read@ method.  Otherwise, an error will be thrown."


        "That seems really wierd that the mixin requires certain methods that it doesn't already have.
        It seems like it should work by itself."


        Dr. Cham looked up from the keyboard at the goat.  "Well, it's sort of like your video collection.
        None of your video cassettes work unless they are put in a machine that uses video cassettes.
        The depend on each other.  A mixin has some basic requirements, but once a class meets those
        requirements, you can add all this extra functionality in."


        "Hey, that's cool," said the goat.


        "You read the book thirty times and you didn't pick that up?" asked Dr. Cham.


        "You're a much better teacher in person," said the goat.  "I really didn't think I was going
        to like you very much."


        "I completely understand," said the Doctor.  "This is much more real than the cartoons
        make it seem."


        <pre>
         require 'wishmaker'
         reader = MindReader.new
         wisher = WishMaker.new
         loop do
           wish = reader.scan_for_a_wish
           if wish
             wisher.grant( wish )
           end
         end
        </pre>



        Irb sat and looped on the screen.  It'll do that until you hit Control-C.  But Dr. Cham let it
        churn away.  Looping endlessly, scanning the mind waves for a proper wish.


        And Dr. Cham readied his wish.  At first, he thought immediately of a @stallion@.  To ride bareback
        over the vales of Sedna.  But he pulled the thought back, his wish hadn't been formed properly.
        A stallion was useless in pursuing The Originals, so he closed his eyes again, bit his lip
        and he thought to himself: @wish: whale@.


        h3. Last Whale to Peoplemud


        The blocky, sullen whale appeared down at the castle entrance, where Hannah was
        bashing on a rosebud with her hand.  She whacked at it with a fist, but it only stayed
        perfect and pleasant and crisp against the solid blue sky of Endertromb.


        "I'm bored," she said to the whale.  *BOHR-BOHR-OHRRRRRR.*


        "Ok," said the whale, deep and soft.  As the word slid along his massive tongue, its
        edges chipped off and the word slid out polished and worn in a bubble by his mouth's
        corner.


        "I always have to die," said the young ghost.  "People always kill me."


        The whale fluttered his short fins, which hung at useless distance from the ground.
        So, he pushed himself toward her with his tail.  Scooting over patches of grass.


        "People kill, so who do they kill?" said the girl.  "Me.  They kill me every time."


        The whale made it to within three meters of the girl, where he towered like a
        great war monument that represents enough dead soldiers to actually steal a lumbering step
        towards you.  And now, the whale rested his tail and, exhausted by the climb thus far,
        let his eyelids fall shut and became a gently puffing clay mountain, his shadow
        rich and doubled-up all around the hardly visible Hannah.


        But another shadow combined, narrow and determined.  Right behind her, the hand came
        on to her shoulder, and the warm ghost inside the hand touched her sleeve.


        "How did you get down here?" said the girl.


        Dr. Cham sat right alongside her and the goat walked around and stood in front.


        "Listen to us," said Dr. Cham.  "We've got to follow this mangy pack of ne'er-do-wells
        to the very end, Hannah.  And to nab them, we need your faithful assistance!"


        "I'm scared," cried Hannah.


        "You're not scared," said the goat.  "Come on.  You're a terrifying little phantom child."


        "Well," she said.  "I'm a little bored."


        Dr. Cham bent down on a knee, bringing his shaggy presence toward the ground, his face
        just inches from hers.  "If you come with us, if you can trust what we know, then we can bag
        this foul troupe.  Now, you say your destiny is to be a baker.  I won't dispute that.
        You have every right on Earth -- and Endertromb, for that matter -- to become a baker.
        Say, if you didn't become a baker, that would be a great tragedy.  Who's going to take
        care of all those donuts if you don't?" 


        She shrugged.  "That's what I've been saying."


        "You're right," said the Doctor.  "You've been saying it from the start."  He looked up to
        the sky, where the wind whistled peacefully despite its forceful piercing by The Originals'
        rocketship.  "If your destiny is to be a baker, then mine is to stop all this, to end the
        mayhem that is just beginning to boil.  And hear me, child -- hear how sure and solid my voice
        becomes when I say this -- I ended your life, I bear sole responsibility for your life as
        an apparition, but I will get it back.  It's going to take more than a donut, but you will
        have a real childhood.  I promise you."


        !i/whale.escape-1.jpg(On the wished whale... away...)!


        Sure, it took a minute for the goat to cut his wish down to ten letters, but he was shortly on
        his way, following the same jetstreams up into the sky, up toward Dr. Cham and his ghost
        niece Hannah.  Up toward the villanous animal combo pak called The Originals.  Up toward
        The Rockettes.


        And Digger Dosh bludgeoned and feasted on each second they left behind them.

      !i/wixl-2.gif(This heist goes all the way up?)!


      Oblivious to their involvement in the expansive plan of The Originals, both the tall fox and the
      much shorter fox had wandered right into the red alert zone, the city Wixl.  I desire a spatula
      to scoop them aside with, shuffle them off to the coast near the beach hatcheries, hide them in
      piles of fish eggs, hold down their pointy ears, concealing their luxurious hides.  And above them
      I would stand, casting an unmoving shadow, holding my rifle aloof.


      I can't.  I have you to teach.  I have to groom and care for myself.  The lightbulbs
      upstairs need changing.  A free pack of halogen lightbulbs just showed up out of the mail.  Somebody out
      there is obviously trying to get me to use them.  So I'm going to screw 'em in.  And just stand there,
      casting an unmoving shadow, holding my rifle aloof.


      Should that shadow be nice and defined, then I'll keep 'em.

        !i/wixl-7.gif(Sitting for a moment.)!


        I like seeing these two out in the wild.  They got pretty bored here in the studio.  They started making
        up wierd slogans and stuff.  They had some phrase they kept repeating, forming fixations upon.
        You can't be exposed to all that contrived fox nonsense.
        

        Let's just say: I am really trying my best to keep things collegiate.  Having never attended college, I can't
        well say if every passage written chimes right with the stringent criteria which academia demands.
        I have university friends aplenty, some who tour the globe in their pursuits, and I try to
        inflect my voice with just their blend of high culture.


        Sometimes I applaud myself for going beyond the work of my educated friends -- only in quiet corridors, we never
        butt heads publicly -- because _I have actually subscribed_ to a school of thought while they are still
        in their books, turning and turning.


        *I am a preeventualist.*  I have dabbled in it long enough and am glad to come forth with it.
        Inevitably, some of you have already started mining this book for Marxist symbology.  I am sad
        to kill those interpretations, but I believe any nihilist conclusions you've drawn will still hold up
        under scrutiny.


        Anyway, I'll drop the rhetoric.  I only mention preeventualism because, aside from being a refreshing
        and easy alternative to the post-modernism we're born with, _this_ meta-cult offers a free lost-and-found
        service for the residents of Wixl.

        I have no way of alerting the foxes to this service.  And I'm sure it's too soon for their truck to be listed.

          we're all sifting through the carpet here at hq, but if you could all keep an eye out 
          for caitlin's clipboard, she's too quiet of a gal to post it and i know that it's 
          REALLY important to her.  she had a few really expensive panoramic radiographs of her 
          husband's underbite clipped to a few irreplacable photos of her husband in a robocop 
          costume back when the underbite was more prominent.  she says (to me), "they'll know
          what i mean when they see them."  i don't know what that means.  :(

          i've checked: * the front desk * the hall * the waiting area * the bathroom * the candy 
          closet * the big tv area * the lunch counter * the disciples room * gaff's old room
          (the one with the painting of the cherry tree) * the server room * staircase.  i'll 
          update this as i find more rooms.
                                                           - love, perry

          / 25 Feb 2005 /
          server went down at 3 o'clock.  i'm mad as you guys.  gaff is downstairs and he'll 
          be down there until he gets it fixed. :O -- UPDATE: it's fixed, back in bizz!!

          i know there's a lot of noise today.  stanley bros circus lost twelve llamas and a
          trailer and a bunch of Masterlocks and five tents.  they're still finding lost stuff.
          pls keep your heads, i need everyone's help.  these entertainers have _nothing_.  i 
          mean it.  i gave a guy a purple sticker today (it's just something i like to do as a
          kind gesture) and he practically slept on it and farmed the ingredients for pizza sauce
          on it.  they are on rock bottom.

          so please donate.  i know we don't have paypal or anything.  so if you want to donate,
          just post that you found something (a children's bike, a month of perishable canned 
          goods) and that it has the circus people's names written on it or something.
                                                           - great, perry

          / 15 Nov 2004 /
          preeventualist's day sale.  if you lose something today, you get to pick one free 
          item (of $40 value or less) from the house of somebody who found something.  we're 
          having so much fun with this!!  this is EXACTLY how i got my rowing machine last year
          and i LOVE IT!!

        I think the Youth Study Clan is doing a great job with this service.  It's a little hokey and
        threadbare, but if it can get animals to stop using their instinctive means of declaring ownership,
        then hats off.


        Still, a preeventualist youth group?  How can that be?  You've got to at least _flirted with
        real cynicism_ before you can become a preeventualist.  And you definitely can't attend school.
        So, I don't know.


        Going back to the list of instructions from the Preeventualist's Losing and Finding Registry.


        <pre class="text">
         USING THE L&F SERVER
         ====================
         The L&F is a free service.  The acts of losing and finding are essential qualities in
         building a preeventualist lifestyle.  We hope to accomodate your belief.


         We do not use HTML, in order to simplify our work here.  Our guys are already working
         fifteen hour days.  (Thanks, Terk!!  Thanks, Horace!!)


         You may search our service for your lost items.  Or you may add your lost (or found)
         item to our registry.  This is done by typing the proper address into your browser.

         SEARCHING
         =========
         To search for lost items, use the following address:

           http://preeventualist.org/lost/search?q={search word}

         You may replace {search word} with your search term.  For example, to search for "cup":

           http://preeventualist.org/lost/search?q=cup

         You will be given a list of cups which have been lost or found.

         If you want to search for only lost cups or only found cups, use the `searchlost' and
         `searchfound' pages:

           http://preeventualist.org/lost/searchlost?q=cup
        </pre>


        I'm not playing games.  I know where the truck is.  Really, I'm not teasing you.  I'll 
        show you in just a sec.  I'm just saying, look at the foxes:


        !i/wixl-11.gif(Hummmmm.)!


        They are helpless.  And yet, here is this great tool.  A possible key to getting out of this mess.
        I just want to poke around, see if there are any clues here.


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'
         
         # Searching all found items containing the word `truck'.
         open( "http://preeventualist.org/lost/searchfound?q=truck" ) do |truck|
           puts truck.read
         end
        </pre>


        I'm not seeing anything about the tall fox's truck in this list.  That's okay.
        The foxes are out of it anyway.  We have some time.


        You've learned a very simple technique for retrieving a web page from the Internet.  The code
        uses the @OpenURI@ library, which was written by one of my favorite Rubyists, Akira Tanaka.  He's
        simplified reading from the Internet so that it's identical to reading a file from your computer.


        In a previous chapter, we stored your diabolical ideas in a text file.  You read these files in Ruby
        using @open@.


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'

         # Opening an idea file from a folder on your computer.
         open( "folder/idea-about-hiding-lettuce-in-the-church-chairs.txt" ) do |idea|
           puts idea.read
         end
        </pre>


        Files are *input-output objects*.  You can read and write to a file.  In Ruby, all IO (input-output)
        objects have @read@ and @write@ methods.  The @open@ method slides an IO object *down the chute*
        into a block for your use.  IO is your ticket to the outside world.  It's the rays of sunlight cast
        through the prison bars.  (However, you can't @write@ to a web page with @OpenURI@.  You'll need to find a
        tool for copying to your web server.  An FTP program, for instance.)


        If someone wants to read your diabolical idea about hiding lettuce in the church chairs, assuming
        you've posted it as a web page:


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'

         # Opening an idea file available on a web site.
         open( "http://your.com/idea-about-hiding-lettuce-in-the-church-chairs.txt" ) do |idea|
           puts idea.read
         end
        </pre>


        The @OpenURI@ library also understands FTP addresses as well.  This widens the possibilities for
        where you can store files.  On your system or elsewhere on the Internet.


        h3. Reading Files Line by Line


        When you're using @OpenURI@ to get information from the web with the @open@ and @read@ methods,
        the page is given to you as a @String@.  You can also read the page one line at a time, if you're
        searching for something.  Or if the page is big and you want to conserve your computer's memory.


        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'
         open( "http://preeventualist.org/lost/searchfound?q=truck" ) do |truck|
           truck.each_line do |line|
             puts line if line['pickup']
           end
         end
        </pre>


        The above code will retrieve the list of trucks found by preeventualists, then display only
        those lines that actually contain the word 'pickup'.
        That way we can trim out the descriptions and look for only the pertinent lines.


        Above, the *index brackets* are used on a string, so the string is searched for whatever is inside
        the brackets.  Since the string @'pickup'@ is inside the brackets, the @line@ string is searched
        for the word "pickup".


        !i/wixl-13.gif(On being funny.)!


        When a web page is loaded with @read@, the entire page is loaded into memory.  Usually this
        only takes up a few thousand bytes.  But if a page is big (several megabytes), you'll probably
        want to use @each_line@, which loads one line at a time to avoid exhausting memory.


        h3. Yielding is Kiddie Blocks


        Ruby often uses iterators in this fashion.  Yes, iterators are used for cycling through each item in
        a collection of items, such as an array or hash.  Now look at an IO source as a collection of lines. 
        The iterator can crawl that collection of lines.


        <pre>
         class IO
           # Definition for the each_line method.  Notice how it has no
           # argument list.  Blocks don't need to be listed as arguments.
           def each_line
             until eof?        # until we reach the end of the file...
               yield readline  # pass a line into the block
             end
           end
         end
        </pre>


        The @yield@ keyword is the easiest way to use a block.  One word.  Just like a curtain has
        a pullstring or like a suitcase has a handle.  Inside a method, you can press the blinking
        @yield@ button and it will run the block attached to that method.  Glowing a strong red color
        until the code inside the block is done.  And then it goes back to blinking and you can press
        the button again if you like.


        <pre>
         def yield_thrice
           yield
           yield
           yield
         end
        </pre>


        Punch the @yield@ button three times quick and the block gets to live its life three times.


        <pre>
         irb> a = ['first, birth.', 'then, a life of flickering images.', 'and, finally, the end.']
         irb> yield_thrice { puts a.shift }
         # prints out:
         #   first, birth.
         #   then, a life of flickering images.
         #   and, finally, the end.
        </pre>


        The @shift@ method pulls the first item off an array.  The barber @shift@ cuts the hair off
        and hands it over.  Then, the scalp.  And just keeps going, whittling the poor guy down to
        nothing.


        You've seen blocks attached to methods.  Any Ruby method can have block attached to the end.


        <pre>
         # The brief style of attaching a block to a method.
         # Here the block is surrounded with curly braces.
         open( "idea.txt" ) { |f| f.read }

         # The verbose style of attaching a block to a method.
         # Here the block is surrounded with `do' and `end'
         open( "idea.txt" ) do |f|
           f.read
         end
        </pre>


        If you pass arguments to @yield@, those arguments will also be passed to the block.
        The block is riding in a little sidecar attached to the method's motorcycle.  The method
        yells out a list arguments, screaming to the block over all the wind as they're
        racing through the desert.  The block taps his helmet like, "I get it, my brain gets it."


        <pre>
         # The method opens two files and slides the resulting IO objects down the
         # chute to an attached block.
         def double_open filename1, filename2
           open( filename1 ) do |f1|
             open( filename2 ) do |f2|
               yield f1, f2
             end
           end
         end

         # Prints the files out side-by-side.
         double_open( "idea1.txt", "idea2.txt" ) do |f1, f2|
           puts f1.readline + " | " + f2.readline
         end
        </pre>


        You may also wonder what the @yield@ keyword has to do with street signs.  And really,
        it's a good question with, I believe, a good answer.  When you run a method, you are giving
        that method control of your program.  Control to do its job and then come back to with an
        answer.


        With @yield@, the method is stopping at the intersection, giving control back to you, to your block.  The method is letting
        you do your work before resuming its work.  So while the @each_line@ method does the work of actually
        reading lines from a file, the *block attached to the @each_line@ method* is handed the line
        itself and gets a chance to hammer away at it in the sidecar.


        h3. Preeventualism in a Gilded Box


        You've learned so much about @OpenURI@ and using @yield@ to write your own iterators.
        You know your way around the lost-and-found service.  Really, you can starting hunting
        through the Wixl junk drawer without me.


        Let's neatly _encapsulate_ the entire service into a single class.

        
        <pre>
         require 'open-uri'
         module PreEventualist
           def self.open page, query
             qs = 
               query.map do |k, v|
                 URI.escape "#{ k }=#{ v }"
               end.join "&"
             URI.parse( "http://preeventualist.org/lost/" + page + "?" + qs ).open do |lost|
               lost.read.split( "--\n" )
             end
           end
           def self.search word
             open "search", "q" => word
           end
           def self.searchlost word
             open "searchlost", "q" => word
           end
           def self.searchfound word
             open "searchfound", "q" => word
           end
           def self.addfound your_name, item_lost, found_at, description
             open "addfound", "name" => your_name, "item" => item_lost, 
                              "at" => found_at, "desc" => description
           end
           def self.addlost your_name, item_found, last_seen, description
             open "addlost", "name" => your_name, "item" => item_found,
                             "seen" => last_seen, "desc" => description
           end
         end
        </pre>


        At some point with your code, you need to start shaping it into something neat.  Save the above
        module in a file called @preeventualist.rb@.


        This module is a very simple library for using the Preeventualist's service.  This is exactly the
        way libraries are written.  You whip up a module or a class, store it in a file, and, if you're
        happy with it and want the world to benefit, put it on the web.


        These stragglers can you use your module just like I used @OpenURI@ earlier.

        _When I first began my inquiry into preeventualism, I was relayed the following story.  I was told that
        this was all I needed to understand the philosophy._


        There was this sculptor who just wasn't satisfied with his work.  He had primarily studied traditional subject
        matter and excelled at sculpting both the human figure and elaborate vegetation.  And he was really quite
        an exquisite sculptor.  He just didn't feel like he was making his mark upon the world.


        By this time, he had aged well into his fifties and wanted to vaunt into the realm of legendary masters.
        So he began to construct a massive sculpture of two pears with beads of dew clinging precariously to
        them.


        The sculpture was enormous and hovered ominously above the sculptor's hometown, held aloof by a massive
        infrastructure of struts and beams.
        In fact, the giant pears were so significant that they truly wreaked havoc on the Earth's rotation,
        everso slightly, what with a new asteroid-sized fruit basket clinging to it.


        The government sent jets and warcrafts to destroy the statue.  They unleashed a vicious attack on the village,
        dismantling the statue, blowing it into thousands of pieces, chipping away at it with missiles.  Soon enough,
        the statue was obliterated and all was back to normal.


        A huge chunk of the statue had taken orbit in the heavens and often veered perilously close to the
        planet.  When it did, it was always met by an arsenal of advanced weaponry, which further damaged it
        and deflected its course skyward.


        Eventually, this inadvertant meteor was nothing more than the size of a very daunting man.  And, when it
        at last hit the ground, weathered and polished by its ninety year journey, it was hailed as an enigmatic
        masterpiece, a message from the great beyond.  Here was a stunning likeness of a male nude looking 
        wistfully into the sky with an intricate lacework of vines creeping around his waist and covering his 
        improprieties.

        
        The statue was last sold for fifty-two million dollars and stayed in the permanent exhibit at the Louvre,
        with the plaque:


        bq. "Heavenly Nude" by Anonymous

    - >

        "Who's Lester?" said the Fox Small.


        "Lester's my cab driver!  He parked at the base of Dwemthy's Array!!"  The rabbit ricocheted madly like a screensaver
        for a supercomputer.  _"Just ask Dwemthy!!"_


        "Well," said the Fox Small.  He turned back to look up at Fox Tall, who was sitting straight and looking far into
        the distance.  "Wait, they have a parking lot on Dwemthy's Array?"
        
        
        *"YEP!!*  And a pretzel stand!!"


        "But, it's _an Array_?  Do they sell churros?"


        *"CHOCOLAVA!!"* bleeted the rabbit.


        "What about those glow-in-the-dark ropes that you can put in your hair?  Or you can just hold them by your side or up
        in the air--"


        *"BRAIDQUEST!!"*


        "You should get a cut of the salesman's commission," spoke Fox Small.  "Folks came out to see you kill the dragon, right?"


        *"BUT!!*  I don't operate the tongs that actually extract the chocolava."


        "I'm just sayin.  You *do* operate the killing mechanism.  So you _have a stake_ in the ensalada."


        "OH NO!!  I left my favorite lettuce leaves in Dwemthy's Array!!" squealed the rabbit, twirling like a celebratory saber through
        the quaking oak.  Distantly: "Or Lester's trunk, maybe?"
        
        
        "You know-- Gheesh, can you stay put??" said Fox Small.
        
        
        "My radio," said Fox Tall, stirring to life for a moment, "in my pickup."  The glaze still seeping from his eyes.  His stare quivered and
        set back into his face, recalling another time and place.  A drive out to Maryland.  Sounds of Lionel Richie coming in
        so clearly.  The wipers going a bit too fast.  He pulls up to a house.  His mother answers the door.
        She is a heavily fluffed fox.  Tears and makeup.


        Slumping back down, "That porcupine is changing my presets."


        The rabbit bounded up on to the armrest of the park bench and spoke closely.  *"BUT!!* Soon I will feast on
        drgn's head and the juices of drgn's tongue!!"  The rabbit sat still and held his paws kindly.


        "(Which I hope will taste like cinnamon bears,)" whispered the rabbit, intimately.


        "I love cinammon," said Fox Small.  "I should go killing with you some time."


        "You should," said the rabbit and the eyes shine-shined.


        "Although, salivating over a tongue.  You don't salivate over it, do you?"


        "I DO!!" and the rabbit got so excited that Sticky Whip shot out of his eyes.  (More on Sticky Whip in a later sidebar.
        Don't let me forget.  See also: _The Purist's Compendium to Novelty Retinal Cremes_ by Jory Patrick Sobgoblin, available wherever animal
        attachment clips are sold.)


        "Okay, you've hooked me.  I want to hear all about it," Fox Small declared.
        "Please, talk freely about the chimbly.  Oh, and Dwemthy.  Who is he?  What makes him tick?  Then maybe, if I'm still around after
        that, you can tell me about what makes rabbits tick, and maybe you can hold our hands through this whole missing truck ordeal.
        I need consolation more than anything else.  I could probably use religion right now.  I could use your personal bravery and
        this sense of accomplishment you exude.  Do you smoke a pipe?  Could be a handy tool to coax along the pontification we
        must engage in."


        And the rabbit began expounding upon Dwemthy and the legend of Dwemthy and the ways of Dwemthy.
        As with most stories of Dwemthy, the rabbit's tales were mostly embellishments.
        Smotchkkiss, there are delicacies which I alone must address.


        Please, never ask who Dwemthy is. Obviously he is a mastermind and would never disclose his location or true identity. He has sired dynasties. He has set living ogres aflame. Horses everywhere smell him at all times. Most of all, he knows carnal pleasures. And to think that this...


        This is his Array.

        _If you don't understand Dwemthy's Array, it is Dwemthy's fault. He designed the game to complicate our lives and were it simpler, it would not be the awe-inspiring quest we've come to cherish in our arms this very hour._


        Dwemthy's Array has a winding history of great depth.  It is not enough to simply say, "Dwemthy's
        Array," over and over and expect to build credentials from that act alone.  Come with me, I can take you back
        a couple years, back to the sixties where it all started with metaprogramming and the dolphins.


        You might be inclined to think that *metaprogramming* is another hacker word and was first overheard in private
        phone calls between fax machines.  Honest to God, I am here to tell you that it is stranger than that.
        Metaprogramming began with _taking drugs in the company of dolphins_.


        In the sixties, a prolific scientist named John C. Lilly began experimenting with his own senses,
        to uncover the workings of his body.  I can relate to this.  I do this frequently when I am standing
        in the middle of a road holding a pie or when I am hiding inside a cathedral.  I pause to examine
        my self.  This has proven to be nigh impossible.  I have filled three ruled pages with algebraic
        notation, none of which has explained anything.  The pie, incidentally, has been very easy to express
        mathematically.


        But the scientist Lilly went about his experiments otherwise.  He ingested LSD in the company of dolphins.
        Often in a dark, woeful isolation tank full of warm salt water.  Pretty bleak.  But it was science!  (Lest you think him
        criminal: until 1966, LSD was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories to any interested scientists, free of charge.)


        *Drugs, dolphins and deprivation.*  Which led to Lilly's foray into things meta.  He wrote books on
        mental programming, comparing humans and computers.  You may choose to ingest any substance you want during
        this next quote -- most likely you're reaching for the grain of salt -- but I assure you that there's
        no Grateful Dead show on the lawn and no ravers in the basement.


        bq. When one learns to learn, one is making models, using symbols, analogizing, making metaphors, in short, inventing and using language, mathematics, art, politics, business, etc. At the critical brain (cortex) size, languages and its consequences appear. To avoid the necessity of repeating learning to learn, symbols, metaphors, models each time, I symbolize the underlying idea in these operations as metaprogramming.


        bq(attrib). John C. Lilly, _Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer_, New York, 1972.


        We learn.  But first we learn to learn.  We setup programming in our mind which is the pathway to further
        programming.  (Lilly is largely talking about programming the brain and the nervous system, which he
        collectively called the _biocomputer_.)


        Lilly's metaprogramming was more about feeding yourself imagery, reinventing yourself, all that.
        This sort of thinking links directly to folks out there who dabble in shamanism, wave their hands over tarot cards and
        wake up early for karate class.  I guess you could say metaprogramming is New Age, but it's all settled down
        recently into a sleeping bag with plain old nerdiness.  (If you got here from a Google search for "C++ Metaprogramming",
        stick around, but I only ask that you _burn_ those neural pathways that originally invoked the search.  Many thanks.)


        Meta itself is spoken of no differently in your author's present day.


        bq. All sensuous response to reality is an interpretation of
        it.  Beetles and monkeys clearly interpret their world, and act on the basis of what they see.
        Our physical senses are themselves organs of interpretation.  What distinguishes us from our fellow
        animals is that we are able in turn to interpret these interpretations.  In that sense, all human
        language is meta-language.  It is a second-order reflection on the 'language' of our bodies --
        of our sensory apparatus.
         

        bq(attrib). Terry Eagleton, _After Theory_, London, 2003, ch. 3.


        To that end, you could say programming itself is a meta-language.  _All code_ speaks the language of action,
        of a plan which hasn't been played yet, but shortly will.  Stage directions for the players inside your
        machine.  I've waxed sentimental on this before.


        But now we're advancing our study, venturing into metaprogramming, but don't sweat it, *it's still just the
        Ruby you've seen already*, which is why Dwemthy feels no qualms thrusting it at you right away.  Soon enough it will be
        as easy to spot as addition or subtraction.  At first it may seem intensely bright, like you've stumbled across your
        first firefly, which has flown up in your face.  Then, it becomes just _a little bobbing light_ which makes living
        in Ohio so much nicer.

        Metaprogramming is _writing code which writes code_.  But not as M.C. Escher would sketch it.  *The program isn't reaching
        back around and overwriting itself, nor is the program jumping onto your screen and wrenching the keyboard from your
        hands.*  No, it's much smaller than that.


        Let's say it's more like *a little orange pill* you won at the circus.  When you suck on it, the coating wears away and
        behind your teeth hatches a massive, floppy sponge brontosaurus.  He slides down your tongue and leaps free, frollicking 
        over the pastures, yelping, "Papa!"  And from then on, whenever he freaks out and attacks a van, well, that van is _sparkling
        clean_ afterwards.


        Now, let's say _someone else_ puts *their little orange pill* under the faucet.  Not on their tongue, _under the faucet_.  And this triggers a different catalysm, which
        births a set of wailing sponge sextuplets.  *Umbilical cords and everything.*  Still very handy for cleaning the van.
        But an altogether different kind of chamois.  And, one day, these eight will stir Papa to tears when they perform the
        violin concerto of their lives.


        Metaprogramming is packing code into pill-form, such that a slender drop of water could trigger it to expand.
        More importantly, you can control the pill's reaction, so that a brontosaurus is produced, scaly and lumbering.
        Or septulets, *CERTAINLY*.  Or seamstresses.  Or cat brains.  Or dragons.


        <pre>
         class Dragon < Creature
           life 1340     # tough scales
           strength 451  # bristling veins
           charisma 1020 # toothy smile
           weapon 939    # fire breath
         end
        </pre>


        This is not metaprogramming yet.  Only the pill.  The _product_ of metaprogramming.  We are pausing, looking at
        the beast itself before descending beneath its flesh with a scalpel and microscope.


        The @Dragon@ is a class.  You've seen that many times now.  The @Dragon@ is a descendant of the @Creature@ class.


        Now, eyes up.  Look at me.  The @Creature@ class contains the metaprogramming code.  You can write metaprogramming
        code which can be used _everywhere_, throughout Ruby, in @Creature@ or @Dragon@, in @String@ or in @Object@, anywhere.
        Our example here, since this is the most common form of meta-code, focuses on metaprogramming inside your own
        classes only.


        Each of the @Dragon@'s traits are simply *class methods*.  You could also write this as:


        <pre>
         class Dragon < Creature
           life( 1340 )     # tough scales
           strength( 451 )  # bristling veins
           charisma( 1020 ) # toothy smile
           weapon( 939 )    # fire breath
         end
        </pre>


        Removing the parens removes clutter, so let's leave them out.  Only use parens when you are using
        several methods together and you want to be very clear.


        h3. Creature Code


        Now, with a lateral slice across the diaphragm, we expose the innards of @Creature@.  *Save this
        code into a file called @dwemthy.rb@.*


        <pre>
         # The guts of life force within Dwemthy's Array
         class Creature

           # Get a metaclass for this class
           def self.metaclass; class << self; self; end; end

           # Advanced metaprogramming code for nice, clean traits
           def self.traits( *arr )
             return @traits if arr.empty?

             # 1. Set up accessors for each variable
             attr_accessor *arr

             # 2. Add a new class method to for each trait.
             arr.each do |a|
               metaclass.instance_eval do
                 define_method( a ) do |val|
                   @traits ||= {}
                   @traits[a] = val
                 end
               end
             end

             # 3. For each monster, the `initialize' method
             #    should use the default number for each trait.
             class_eval do
               define_method( :initialize ) do
                 self.class.traits.each do |k,v|
                   instance_variable_set("@#{k}", v)
                 end
               end
             end

           end

           # Creature attributes are read-only
           traits :life, :strength, :charisma, :weapon
         end
        </pre>


        Focus on the closing lines of code, specifically the line where the @traits@ are
        being set up.  All of the code before that line sets up the @traits@ class
        method.  This bears resemblance to the basic lottery tickets from the chapter previous.
        

        <pre>
         class LotteryTicket
           attr_reader :picks, :purchased
         end
        </pre>


        Both @traits@ and @attr_reader@ are simply class methods.  When @attr_reader@ is used in the @LotteryTicket@,
        metaprogramming kicks in behind the scenes and starts blowing up balloons, creating
        *reader* methods for the instance variables @@picks@ and @@purchased@ above.


        The code for the @traits@ method is the metaprogramming I've been alluding to.
        Comments in the code reveal the three stages the method goes through when adding
        traits.


        # The *list of traits is passed on to @attr_accessor@*, which builds *reader* and
        *writer* code for instance variables.  One for each trait.

        # *Class methods are added* for each trait.  (A @life@ class method is added for a @:life@
        trait.)  These class methods are used
        in the class definition just like you would use @traits@ or @attr_accessor@.  This way, you can specify
        the trait, along with the points given for a trait to a certain creature.

        # *Add an initialize method* which sets up a new monster properly,
        grabbing the right points and _POWER UP! POWER UP!_ the monster is
        alive!


        The beauty of these three steps is that you've taught Ruby how to code
        monsters for you.  So when Ruby gets to the @traits@:


        <pre>
         class Creature
           traits :life, :strength, :charisma, :weapon
         end
        </pre>


        Ruby fills in the code behind the scenes and transplants a spiny green
        heart and jumpstarts the body with a pullcord.
        Ruby will use the metaprogramming from the @Creature@ class and build
        out all the various methods, expanding the @traits@ list like this:


        <pre>
         class Creature
         
           # 1. set up reader and writer methods
           attr_accessor :life, :strength, :charisma, :weapon

           # 2. add new class methods to use in creature
           def self.life( val )
             @traits ||= {}
             @traits['life'] = val
           end

           def self.strength( val )
             @traits ||= {}
             @traits['strength'] = val
           end

           def self.charisma( val )
             @traits ||= {}
             @traits['charisma'] = val
           end

           def self.weapon( val )
             @traits ||= {}
             @traits['weapon'] = val
           end

           # 3. initialize sets the default points for
           #    each trait
           def initialize
             self.class.traits.each do |k,v|
               instance_variable_set("@#{k}", v)
             end
           end

         end
        </pre>


        Now, Ruby will gladly accept this
        six-line @Dragon@ code, short enough to look nice when printed on playing
        cards:


        <pre>
         class Dragon < Creature
           life 1340     # tough scales
           strength 451  # bristling veins
           charisma 1020 # toothy smile
           weapon 939    # fire breath
         end
        </pre>


        h3. Eval, the Littlest Metaprogrammer


        While the metaprogramming code above is just plain Ruby, it can be difficult to follow still.
        I totally understand if you've come to this point and your eyes are spinning in their sockets
        and your knees have locked up.  The trickiest parts of the above are the lines which call
        the methods @instance_eval@ and @class_eval@.  Just rub some tiger balm on your joints while
        I talk about @eval@.


        We've been talking about *metaprogramming*.  Writing code which writes code.  The @eval@
        method hangs out in this alley.
        The vagrant @eval@ takes code you have stored up in a string and it executes that code.


        <pre>
         drgn = Dragon.new
         # is identical to...
         drgn = eval( "Dragon.new" )
         # or, alternatively...
         eval( "drgn = Dragon.new" )
        </pre>


        Here, let's write a program which has a hole in it.  Instead of writing a program
        which creates a new @Dragon@, let's leave a hole where the @Dragon@ would be.


        <pre>
         print "What monster class have you come to battle? "
         monster_class = gets
         eval( "monster = " + monster_class + ".new" )
         p monster
        </pre>


        The program asks for a monster.  If you type in @Dragon@, then the @monster_class@ variable
        will contain the string @"Dragon"@.  Inside the @eval@, a few strings get added together
        to make the string @"monster = Dragon.new"@.  And when the @eval@ executes this string,
        the @monster@ variable contains a @Dragon@ object.  Ready for battle.


        This is great!  Now we can leave it up to the player to pick a monster!  Of course,
        we're trusting the player to supply a real monster class.  If they type in @BotanicalWitch@
        and there is no @BotanicalWitch@ class, they'll get an exception tossed in their face.


        So, in short, @eval@ lets you make up code as you go.  Which can be useful and which can
        be dangerous as well.


        The @instance_eval@ and @class_eval@ method used in the metaprogramming for the @Creature@
        class are slightly different from the normal @eval@.  These two special methods run code just like
        @eval@ does, but they duck into classes and objects and run the code there.


        <pre>
         # The instance_eval method runs code as if it were run inside an
         # object's instance method.
         irb> drgn = Dragon.new
         irb> drgn.instance_eval do
         irb>   @name = "Tobias"
         irb> end

         irb> drgn.instance_variable_get( "@name" )
           => "Tobias"

         # The class_eval method runs code is if inside a class definition.
         irb> Dragon.class_eval do
         irb>   def name; @name; end
         irb> end

         irb> drgn.name
           => "Tobias"
        </pre>


        As you can see above, the @instance_eval@ and @class_eval@ methods also can take a code block
        instead of a string.  Which is just how things are done in Dwemthy's Array.


        h3. Enough Belittling Instruction and Sly Juxtaposition -- Where Is Dwemthy's Array??


        Tread carefully -- here is *the other half of DWEMTHY'S ARRAY!!*
        *Add these lines to @dwemthy.rb@.*


        <pre>
         class Creature

           # This method applies a hit taken during a fight.
           def hit( damage )
             p_up = rand( charisma )
             if p_up % 9 == 7
               @life += p_up / 4
               puts "[#{ self.class } magick powers up #{ p_up }!]"
             end 
             @life -= damage
             puts "[#{ self.class } has died.]" if @life <= 0
           end

           # This method takes one turn in a fight.
           def fight( enemy, weapon )
             if life <= 0
               puts "[#{ self.class } is too dead to fight!]"
               return
             end

             # Attack the opponent
             your_hit = rand( strength + weapon )
             puts "[You hit with #{ your_hit } points of damage!]"
             enemy.hit( your_hit )

             # Retaliation
             p enemy
             if enemy.life > 0
               enemy_hit = rand( enemy.strength + enemy.weapon )
               puts "[Your enemy hit with #{ enemy_hit } points of damage!]"
               self.hit( enemy_hit )
             end
           end

         end

         class DwemthysArray < Array
           alias _inspect inspect
           def inspect; "#<#{ self.class }#{ _inspect }>"; end
           def method_missing( meth, *args )
             answer = first.send( meth, *args )
             if first.life <= 0
               shift
               if empty?
                 puts "[Whoa.  You decimated Dwemthy's Array!]"
               else
                 puts "[Get ready. #{ first.class } has emerged.]"
               end
             end
             answer || 0
           end
         end
        </pre>


        This code adds two methods to @Creature@.  The @hit@ method which reacts to a hit from another
        @Creature@.  And the @fight@ method which lets you place your own blows against that @Creature@.


        When your @Creature@ takes a hit, a bit of defense kicks in and your @charisma@ value is used to generate a power-up.  Don't
        ask me to explain the secrets behind this phenomenon.  A random number is picked, some simple math
        is done, and, if you're lucky, you get a couple life points.  @@life += p_up / 4@.


        Then, the enemy's blow is landed.  @@life -= damage@.  That's how the @Creature#hit@ method works.


        The @fight@ method checks to see if your @Creature@ is alive.  Next, a random
        hit is placed on your opponent.  If your opponent lives through the hit, it gets
        a chance to strike back.  Those are the workings of the @Creature#fight@ method.


        I'll explain @DwemthysArray@ in a second.  I really will.  I'm having fun doing it.
        Let's stick with hitting and fighting for now.


        h3. Introducing: You.


        You may certainly tinker with derivations on this rabbit.  But official
        Dwemthy Paradigms explicitly denote the code -- and the altogether character -- inscribed
        below.  *Save this as @rabbit.rb@.*


        <pre>
         class Rabbit < Creature
           traits :bombs

           life 10
           strength 2
           charisma 44
           weapon 4
           bombs 3

           # little boomerang
           def ^( enemy )
             fight( enemy, 13 )
           end
           # the hero's sword is unlimited!!
           def /( enemy )
             fight( enemy, rand( 4 + ( ( enemy.life % 10 ) ** 2 ) ) )
           end
           # lettuce will build your strength and extra ruffage
           # will fly in the face of your opponent!!
           def %( enemy )
             lettuce = rand( charisma )
             puts "[Healthy lettuce gives you #{ lettuce } life points!!]"
             @life += lettuce
             fight( enemy, 0 )
           end
           # bombs, but you only have three!!
           def *( enemy )
             if @bombs.zero?
               puts "[UHN!! You're out of bombs!!]"
               return
             end
             @bombs -= 1
             fight( enemy, 86 )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        You have four weapons.  The boomerang.  The hero's sword.  The lettuce.  And the bombs.


        To start off, open up @irb@ and load the libraries we've created above.


        <pre>
         irb> require 'dwemthy'
         irb> require 'rabbit'
        </pre>

         
        Now, unroll yourself.


        <pre>
         irb> r = Rabbit.new
         irb> r.life
           => 10
         irb> r.strength
           => 2
        </pre>


        Good, good.


        h3. Rabbit Fights ScubaArgentine!


        You cannot just go rushing into Dwemthy's Array, unseatbelted and merely
        perfumed!!  You must advance deliberately through the demonic cotillion.  Or south,
        through the thickets and labyrinth of coal.


        For now, let's lurk covertly through the milky residue alongside the aqueducts.  And 
        sneak up on the @ScubaArgentine@.


        <pre>
         class ScubaArgentine < Creature
           life 46
           strength 35
           charisma 91
           weapon 2
         end
        </pre>


        To get the fight started, make sure you've created one of you and one of the
        @ScubaArgentine@.


        <pre>
         irb> r = Rabbit.new
         irb> s = ScubaArgentine.new
        </pre>


        Now use the little boomerang!


        <pre>
         irb> r ^ s
         [You hit with 2 points of damage!]
         #<ScubaArgentine:0x808c864 @charisma=91, @strength=35, @life=44, @weapon=2>
         [Your enemy hit with 28 points of damage!]
         [Rabbit has died.]
        </pre>


        For crying out loud!!  Our sample rabbit died!!

      The Shoes Which Lies Are Made Of: >

        _Earlier, I told you that "The Inadvertant Meteor" was the only story you need to know in order to
        understand preeventualism.  But, really, all you need to understand about preeventualism is that
        it is still in its infancy and any of its most basic concepts could change._


        _Which is why I've authored a competing story which I believe uncovers an entirely different
        and very relevant intellectual scenario._


        There was a guy who had been around the block.  And he wasn't very old, so he decided to write
        a biography of his life.


        Well, he started to lie in his biography.  He made up some stories.  But mostly little stories
        that were inconsequential.  Filler.  Like he had a story about a painting he'd done of a red
        background with elephant legs in front.


        But he hadn't ever painted anything of the sort.  He further embellished the story by talking
        about a pricey auction he'd snuck into.  An auction in New York City where he'd he overheard his
        painting go to sale for twenty grand.  But that wasn't the point of the story.  The point was
        that he could fold his body to fit under a lid on a banquet tray.  People would raise the lid and
        they wouldn't even notice him bracing himself inside.  He didn't even mention the price his painting
        sold at.


        Anyway, he really started to like that story (and others like it), to the point where he
        started to ignore his friends and family, instead preferring to watch what his lie self did after the
        auction.  In his head.


        So, then, one day he was shopping and he found a pair of shoes that had stripey laces.
        And he grabbed the shoes and went to the store counter, forcing them in the cashier's
        face, yelling, "Look! Look at these! Look! These are the shoes my lie self would
        wear!"  And he bought the shoes and put them on and the whole Earth cracked open and
        the cash register popped open and swallowed him up and he was suddenly elsewhere, in his
        lie apartment, sitting down to paint dolphin noses, three of them on a green background.


        It was a lot of work, painting all those noses.  And he went broke for a while and had
        to stoop so low as to filming abominable snowman NASCAR.

    - >
        Grim prospects.  I can't ask you to return to the rabbit kingdom, though.
        Just pretend like you didn't die and make a whole new rabbit.


        <pre>
         irb> r = Rabbit.new

         # attacking with boomerang!
         irb> r ^ s

         # the hero's sword slashes!
         irb> r / s

         # eating lettuce gives you life!
         irb> r % s

         # you have three bombs!
         irb> r * s
        </pre>


        Pretty neat looking, wouldn't you say?  The code in @rabbit.rb@ alters a few math symbols
        which work only with the @Rabbit@.  Ruby allows you to change the behavior of math operators.  After all,
        *math operators are just methods!*


        <pre>
         # the boomerang is normally an XOR operator.
         irb> 1.^( 1 )
           => 0

         # the hero's sword normally divides numbers.
         irb> 10./( 2 )
           => 5

         # the lettuce gives the remainder of a division.
         irb> 10.%( 3 )
           => 1

         # the bomb is for multiplication.
         irb> 10.*( 3 )
           => 30
        </pre>


        Where it makes sense, you may choose to use math operators on some of your Classes.  Ruby
        uses these math operators on many of its own classes.  Arrays, for example, have a handful
        of math operators which you can see in the list of instance methods when you type: @ri Array@.


        <pre>
         # the plus operator combines two arrays into a single array
         irb> ["D", "W", "E"] + ["M", "T", "H", "Y"]
           => ["D", "W", "E", "M", "T", "H", "Y"]

         # minus removes all items in the second array found in the first
         irb> ["D", "W", "E", "M", "T", "H", "Y"] - ["W", "T"]
           => ["D", "E", "M", "H", "Y"]

         # the multiplier repeats the elements of an array
         irb> ["D", "W"] * 3
           => ["D", "W", "D", "W", "D", "W"]
        </pre>


        You may be wondering: what does this mean for math, though?  What if I add the number three
        to an array?  What if I add a string and a number?  *How is Ruby going to react?*


        Please remember these operators are just methods.  But, since these operators _aren't readable
        words_, it can be harder to tell what they do.  Use @ri@.  Often you'll find that the operators
        are identical to other readable methods.  You can then choose to use the operator or the method.
        Whichever is clearer to you.


        <pre>
         # divide with an operator method ...
         irb> 10 / 3
           => 3

         # ... or a readable method?
         irb> 10.div 3
           => 3
        </pre>


        And that's how the Rabbit's sword divides. 


        h3. The Harsh Realities of Dwemthy's Array AWAIT YOU TO MASH YOU!!


        Once you're done playchoking the last guy with his oxygen tube, it's time
        to enter The Array.  I doubt you can do it.  You left your hatchet at home.  And
        I hope you didn't use all your bombs on the easy guy.


        You have six foes.


        <pre>
         class IndustrialRaverMonkey < Creature

         end
        </pre>


        These are the living, breathing monstrosities of Dwemthy's Array.  I don't
        know how they got there.  No one knows.  Actually, I'm guessing the @IntrepidDecomposedCyclist@
        rode his ten-speed.  But the others: NO ONE knows.


        If it's really important for you to know, let's just say the others were born there.
        Can we move on??


        As Dwemthy's Array gets deeper, the challenge becomes more difficult.


        <pre>
         dwary = DwemthysArray[IndustrialRaverMonkey.new,
                               DwarvenAngel.new,
                               AssistantViceTentacleAndOmbudsman.new,
                               TeethDeer.new,
                               IntrepidDecomposedCyclist.new,
                               Dragon.new]
        </pre>


        Fight the Array and the monsters will appear as you go.  Godspeed
        and may you return with harrowing tales and nary an angel talon piercing
        through your shoulder.


        Start here:


        <pre>
         irb> r % dwary
        </pre>


        Oh, and none of this "I'm too young to die" business.  I'm sick of that crap.
        I'm not going to have you insulting our undead young people.  They are our future.
        After our future is over, that is.


        !i/wixl.dwemthy-3.gif(The rabbit has changed us.)!


        h3. The Making of Dwemthy's Array


        Fast forward to a time when the winds have calmed.  
        The dragon is vanquished.  The unwashed masses bow.  We love you.
        We are loyal to you.


        But what is this centipede nibbling in your eardrum?  You dig with your finger, but you can't
        get him out!  Blasted!  It's that infernal Dwemthy's Array again.  *Explain yourself
        Dwemthy!*


        Here, I shall unmask the Array itself for you.


        <pre>
         class DwemthysArray < Array
           alias _inspect inspect
           def inspect; "#<#{ self.class }#{ inspect }>"; end
           def method_missing( meth, *args )
             answer = first.send( meth, *args )
             if first.life <= 0
               shift
               if empty?
                 puts "[Whoa.  You decimated Dwemthy's Array!]"
               else
                 puts "[Get ready. #{ first.class } has emerged.]"
               end
             end
             answer || 0
           end
         end
        </pre>


        By now, you're probably feeling very familiar with inheritance.  The @DwemthysArray@ class
        inherits from @Array@ and, thus, behaves just like one.  For being such a mystery, it's
        alarmingly brief, yeah?


        So it's an Array.  Filled with monsters.  But what does this extra code do?


        h3. Inspect


        The @inspect@ method isn't really a necessary part of Dwemthy's Array.  It's something
        Dwemthy added as a courtesy to his guests.  (Many call him twisted, many call him 
        austere, but we'd all be ignorant to go without admiring the footwork he puts in for us.)        


        Every object in Ruby has an @inspect@ method.  It is defined in the @Object@ class,
        so it trickles down through the pedigree to every wee child object just born.


        <pre>
         irb> o = Object.new
           => #<Object:0x81d60c0>
         irb> o.inspect
           => "#<Object:0x81d60c0>"
        </pre>


        Have you noticed this?  Whenever we create an object in @irb@, this noisy @#<Object>@
        verbage stumbles out!  It's a little name badge for the object.  The @inspect@
        method creates that name badge.  The badge is just a string.


        <pre>
         irb> class Rabbit
         irb>   attr_accessor :slogan
         irb>   def initialize s; @slogan = s; end
         irb>   def inspect; "#<#{ self.class } says '#{ @slogan }'>"; end
         irb> end

         irb> class FakeRabbit < Rabbit
         irb> end

         irb> Rabbit.new "i blow'd the drgn's face off!!"
           => #<Rabbit says 'i blow'd the drgn's face off!!'>
         irb> FakeRabbit.new "Thusly and thusly and thusly..."
           => #<FakeRabbit says 'Thusly and thusly and thusly...'>
        </pre>

        
        The thing is: @irb@ is talking back.  Every time you run some code in @irb@,
        the _return value_ from that code is inspected.  How handy.  It's a little
        conversation between you and @irb@.  And @irb@ is just reiterating what you're
        saying so you can see it for your self.


        You could write your own Ruby prompt very easily:


        <pre>
         loop do
           print ">> "
           puts  "=> " + eval( gets ).inspect
         end
        </pre>
         

        This prompt won't let you write Ruby code longer than a single line.  It's the essence
        of interactive Ruby, though.  How do you like that?  Two of your recently learned concepts
        have come together in a most flavorful way.  The @eval@ takes the typed code and runs it.
        The response from @eval@ is then inspected.


        Now, as you are fighting monsters in @irb@, Dwemthy's Array will be inspected and
        replying with the monsters you have left to fight.

        h3. Method Missing


        Don't you hate it when you yell "Deirdre!" and like ten people answer?  That _never_ happens in
        Ruby.  If you call the @deirdre@ method, only one @deirdre@ method answers.  You can't have
        two methods named the same.  If you add a second @deirdre@ method, the first one disappears.


        You can, however, have a method which *answers to many names*.


        <pre>
         class NameCaller
           def method_missing( name, *args )
             puts "You're calling `" + name + "' and you say:"
             args.each { |say| puts "  " + say }
             puts "But no one is there yet."
           end
           def deirdre( *args )
             puts "Deirdre is right here and you say:"
             args.each { |say| puts "  " + say }
             puts "And she loves every second of it."
             puts "(I think she thinks you're poetic.)"
         end
        </pre>


        When you call the method @deirdre@ above, I'm sure you know what will happen.  Deirdre will
        love every second of it, you and your dazzling poetry.


        But what if you call @simon@?


        <pre>
         irb> NameCaller.new.simon( 'Hello?', 'Hello? Simon?' )
         You're calling `simon' and you say:
           Hello?
           Hello? Simon?
         But no one is there yet.
        </pre>
        

        Yes, @method_missing@ is like an answering machine, which intercepts your method call.  In Dwemthy's
        Array we use call forwarding, so that when you attack the Array, it passes that attack on straight to
        the first monster in the Array.


        <pre>
         def method_missing( meth, *args )
           answer = first.send( meth, *args )
           # ... snipped code here ...
         end
        </pre>


        See!  See!  That skinny little @method_missing@ passes the buck!

        !i/porcupine-2.gif(The porcupine and his kite.)!

    - Walking, Walking, Walking, Walking and So Forth: >

        The evening grew dark around the pair of foxes.  They had wound their way through
        alleys packed with singing possums, and streets where giraffes in rumpled sportscoats
        bumped past them with their briefcases.  They kept walking.  


        And now the stores rolled shut their corrugated metal lids.  
        Crickets crawled out from the gutters and nudged at the loose change.


        !i/wixl-6.gif(Why such hard feelings?)!


        "Anyway, you must admit he's a terrible President," said Fox Small. _"Why_ does President Marcos have a rabbit as Vice President of
        the Foxes."


        "The Vice President?  The rabbit with the _eyebrows_?"


        "No, the rabbit with the *huge sausage lips*," said Fox Small.


        But their conversation was abruptly interupted by a freckly cat head which popped from the sky just above the sidewalk.


        !i/wixl.blix-1.gif(At least they're still in the book...)!


        What is this about?!


        !i/wixl-14.gif(Will the book finish?)!


        Oh, come on.  This is rich.  More meta.


        I'm not going to bother illustrating this discussion Blixy had with the foxes at this point!
        It's all a *bunch of _conjecture_*.  _HOW_ can they presume to know the landscape of my family drama?
        I love my sister.  For a long time, I _worshipped_ her. (This is my sister Quil.)


        I admit that there was a pretty painful day a few months ago and I kind of freaked out.  I was
        laid out on the long patio chair by the pool in my mom's backyard.  I had a Dr. Pepper and a bit
        of german chocolate cake.  I was eating with a kid fork.  Everything else was in the dishwasher,
        that's all they had.  Three prongs.


        My mom started talking about Quil.  All about how much money she was blowing on pants and purses.
        A five-hundred dollar purse.  And then she said, "She's losing it.
        She sounded totally high on the phone." (She nailed it on the head, Quil was smoking dope and
        loving it.)


        So I'd been noticing how observant my mom could be.  That's why, when she said, "I actually think she's on
        cocaine," I _physically_ stood up and chucked my soda across the yard.


        It sailed off into the woods somewhere.  We had been talking awhile, so it was dark when the can flew.
        I paced a bit.  And then I screamed at the top of my lungs.


        My uncle Mike was standing there with the glass door open, staring at me.  He said something totally
        nervous like, "Oh, okay.  Well, I'll--"  And the tea in his glass was swishing back and forth, sloshing
        all over.  He disappeared.  He's not very good at saying things to people.  He's more of a whistler.  And resonant.


        !i/wixl.blix-2.gif(Moving along.)!


        So, to be completely honest, yes, I got a little mad.  I got mad.  You know.  I dealt with it.
        Quil calls me regularly.  For some stupid reason, I rarely call her.


        Plus, she didn't end up killing herself.  So it's just not an issue.  Who knows if it was real.
        She just had a lot of vodka.  And she's little.  So it was just scary to see Quil guzzling it down like that.
        I mean forcing it down.
 

        But why talk about it?  It'll just make her feel like I'm disappointed.  Or like I'm a jerk.


        Well, I got off track there a bit.  Where was I?  Blix is basically helping the foxes around, getting them on
        the trail of their truck.  Yeah, back to all that.


        !i/wixl-3.gif(Frogs who save seats on the bus.)!


        "We can't squeeze on to this bus," said the smallest fox.


        "Guys, walk on up," said Blix.  "What's the hold up?  Oh, the frogs.  Yeah, just squeeze through."
        Blixy pushed from behind.


        "Hey," said the Tall Fox.  "I'm crammed on this little step!  Somebody move!"


        "Did you get through-- young fox??" said the cat.


        "No," said Fox Small, "can't you see?  The driver keeps shaking his head and it's _really_
        making me nervous.  I don't think he wants us on."


        "Go," said Blix.  He stepped down from his step and walked around the bus, peering through
        the plexiglass windows.  "Well, I don't know, guys.  I dunno.  I guess it's got a lot of frogs."  He pounded
        on the window.  "Hey!  Move over!"


        And that's the reality of riding intercity transit in Wixl.  It's terribly competitive.  The morning
        bus is so crowded that most white collar animals get frogs to hold their seat through the nighttime.
        For whatever reason, it works.  It's become this staple of their workflow and their economy.


        If you can muster up a bit of imagination, you can see a *percent sign* as a frog's slanted face.
        Got the picture in your head?  Now let me show you frogs that camp out inside strings.


        <pre>
         # The %s format is for placing full strings.
         irb> "Seats are taken by %s and %s." % ['a frog', 'a frog with teeth']
           => "Seats are taken by a frog and a frog with teeth."

         # The %d format is for placing numbers, while the %f format is for
         # floats (decimal numbers).
         irb> frogs = [44, 162.30]
         irb> stats = "Frogs have filled %d seats and paid %f blue crystals."
         irb> stats % frogs
           => "Frogs have filled 44 seats and paid 162.30 blue crystals."

         # Formatting is flexible with types, you can pass in strings
         # and format them like numbers.
         irb> frogs = ['44', '162.30']
         irb> stats % frogs
           => "Frogs have filled 44 seats and paid 162.30 blue crystals."
        </pre>


        What you are seeing above uses the @%@ method in the @String@ class.
        This method takes *a string* and *an array* and slurps them in together
        to create a new string.  The items from the list are yanked out (in order) and
        placed in their saved seats.  It's the open of the business
        day and the frogs have done their job.


        <pre>
         # See, here's the String#% method called like other methods.
         irb> "Please move over, %s.".%( 'toothless frog' )
           => "Please move over, toothless frog"

         # Now let's call it the prettier way, with the percent sign
         # right between the string and the array.
         irb> "Here is your 1098 statement for the year, %s." % ['teeth frog']
           => "Here is your 1098 statement for the year, teeth frog."
        </pre>


        This is also available as the @Kernel::format@ method or @Kernel::sprintf@
        method.  (In the C language, there is a @sprintf@ method which operates
        just like this.)


        <pre>
         irb> format "Frogs are piled %d deep and travel at %d mph.", [5, 56]
           => "Frogs are piled 5 deep and travel at 56 mph."
        </pre>


        For the most part, you'll only need @%s@ (strings), @%d@ (integer numbers)
        or @%f@ (float numbers) format specifiers.  The @%p@ placeholder will
        run @inspect@ on an object.


        Yeah, so, frog formatting is really handy for building strings that are
        assembled from different kinds of data.  You can learn all the various
        kinds of format specifiers by reading the @ri sprintf@ page.  I'm just
        going to give you a few quick pointers.


        Let's say you have the array but you want the items to appear in
        *a different order* in the string.  In such a situation, you can identify
        specific items by placing a number (@1$@ for the first item, @2$@ for the second,
        and so on) right after the percent sign.


        <pre>
         irb> "This bus has %1$d more stops before %2$d o'clock.  That's %1$d more stops." % [16, 8]
           => "This bus has 16 more stops before 8 o'clock.  That's 16 more stops."
        </pre>


        The second tip I have for you is that you can allot a certain number of characters for
        each item, a width.  And if an item is smaller than the width, extra spaces
        will be used before the item.  To pad it.
        If the width is a negative number, the item will be forced to left and the
        padding will come after it.


        <pre>
         # Give one item 30 characters of width
         irb> "In the back of the bus: %30s." % ['frogs']
           => "In the back of the bus:                          frogs."

         # Give one left-justified item 30 characters of width
         irb> "At the front of the bus: %-30s." % ['frogs']
           => "At the front of the bus: frogs                         ."
        </pre>


        Fox Small kept looking up at the bus driver.  Remember, he wouldn't enter the bus!


        "What's the deal?" said Fox Tall.  "Can't you just get on and we'll just stand in the aisle?"


        "You really want to get on this bus?  That driver has no hands," said Fox Small, speaking close
        and hushed to Fox Tall, "and all he has, instead of hands, are sucker cups."

      More From The Chilling Ongoing Preview of The Scarf Eaters: >

        (_from Chapter XII: Thank Heaven for Little Men_.)


        "Close the door," Spencer repeated, but Lara's hand trembled and she fumbled sloppily at the latch.
        Her dad hadn't taught her to close doors like this one.


        "Yes, it's an unusual door," said Brent.  He walked over and closed the door for her.
        Then, he held her hand and looked into her eyes.  His eyes lit up like huge matchsticks
        that would be too huge to be practical.  "It's an unusual handle, which ensures that
        those who don't eat scarves stay out."


        "Sit down, everyone," Spencer demanded, as he bounded across the room and took command.
        "I command this organization," he stated.  "The secret organization of The Scarf Eaters!"


        The torches encircling the room blazed like invincibly huge matches and the handful of
        teenagers sat.  Except for Spencer who stood high and mighty, drawing all the oxygen
        in the entire room into his nostrils before speaking.


        "One of us," he said, dramatically and invincibly, "is missing!"


        The entire room gasped, which also used oxygen.  The room was abuzz.  "Who?"  "How?"
        "Who was it?"  Nobody knew.  Except for Spencer, who lept across the room and took charge.


        "Our dear friend Steve Bridell has been stolen from us," announced Spencer in a deafeningly
        loud voice, as if thousands of giant matchsticks were struck against a brittle surface in
        unison amidst a pile of oxygen.  "Steve Bridell.  Do any of you know Steve Bridell?"


        The hall was silent.


        Spencer continued.  "Steve Bridell was an incredible resource and you all knew him
        and loved him.  He carved this enormous wooden man we use as our podium."  Spencer pointed.
        "He also made the set of wooden cymbals that are back in our instrument closet right now."


        Some of the audience stood.


        "Wait," instructed Spencer.  "Don't go back there.   I've already checked.  The cymbals are
        gone!"


    - >
        "So what?  You don't think animals with tentacles can drive?"


        "Well, not only is he going to flub up the steering wheel but he has all these
        legs all over the foot pedals.  This is not smart.  Let's get another bus.  Come on."
        
        
        "You know, he's probably been driving like that all day.  Is he really going to
        start crashing at this point in his career?"
        

        "Buses do crash," said Fox Small.  "Some do.  This smells crashworthy."


        "Sheer doo-doo!"  And Fox Tall yelled to the driver, "Hey, cabby, how long
        have you been driving this bus for?"


        The bus driver peered over darkly under his cap and started to turn toward them, but his
        tentacles were stuck to the wheel.  He jerked swiftly at his forelegs and, failing their
        release, he turned to the wheel and focused his energies on milking his glands for some
        slicker secretions.  Bubbles of mucus oozed.


        "Let's get outta here," said Fox Tall and the two ran off into the street, slamming right
        into the cat Blix.


        "Alright, well, the bus is full," said Blix.  "I don't know why the driver stopped if he knew the
        bus was crammed with hoppers."


        "We're thinking he was about to crash into us," said Fox Tall, "and he opened the
        door to make it look like a planned route stop."


        "Keep in mind, Blix, we hadn't really discussed that possibility out loud, so I haven't had a chance
        to formally agree," said Fox Small.  "Nevertheless, it sounds rational to me."


        "I'm thinking all the buses are going to be full like this."  Blix bit his lip,
        thinking and flicking his eyes about.  "Let's just--"  He pointed down the circuitry
        of apartment buildings that wound to the south.  "But maybe--"  He looked up and surveyed the stars,
        scratching his head and counting the constellations with very small poking motions
        from the tip of his finger.


        "Are you getting our bearings from the stars and planets?" asked Fox Small.


        Blix didn't speak, he ducked off to the north through a poorly laid avenue
        back behind the paint store.
        But before we follow them down that service road, Smotchkkiss, I have one more
        frog for you, perched on a long lilypad that stretches out to hold anything at all.


        <pre>
         irb> cat = "Blix"
         irb> puts "Does #{ cat } see what's up?  Is #{ cat } aware??"
           => "Does Blix see what's up?  Is Blix aware??"
        </pre>


        The little frogs from earlier (@%s@ or @%d@) were only placeholders for
        single strings.  Saving places in the string.


        The lilypads above start with a flower bud, the *octothorpe*.  You've also
        seen it as a pound sign on telephones.  After the flower bud, two leaves
        form the edges of the lilypad.  The leaves are *curly braces*, also seen many
        times before as the _crab pincers_ for a code block.


        bq. An empty lilypad @"#{}"@ becomes an empty string @""@.


        When the lilypad is found in a *double-quoted* string, Ruby runs any code found in between
        the two leaves of the lilypad.  The lilypad is lifted out and the result of the code is placed there in
        the string.  This lilypad swap is called _string interpolation_.


        <pre>
         irb> fellows = ['Blix', 'Fox Tall', 'Fox Small']
         irb> puts "Let us follow #{ fellows.join ' and ' } on their journey."
           => "Let us follow Blix and Fox Tall and Fox Small on their journey."
        </pre>


        The lilypad is very durable and can hold any kind of code inside.  Above
        we are using @Array#join@, but you can do anything you like inside.  Call
        object methods, conditional @if@ or @case@ statements, even define classes.


        <pre>
         irb> blix_went = :north
         irb> puts "Blix didn't speak, he ducked off to the #{ blix_went } through #{
                     if blix_went == :north
                       'a poorly laid avenue behind the paint store'
                     elsif blix_went == :south
                       'the circuitry of apartment buildings'
                     else
                       '... well, who knows where he went.'
                     end }.  But before we follow them..."
         => "Blix didn't speak, he ducked off to the north through a poorly laid avenue
             behind the paint store.  But before we follow them..."
        </pre>


        The foxes followed Blixy off behind the paint store and down the cracked, uneven asphalt.
        All of the stores on the dilapidated lane leaned at angles to each other.  In some places,
        slabs of sidewalk jutted up from the ground, forming a perilous walkway, a disorderly
        stack of ledges.  Almost as if the city planners had hoped to pay tribute to the techtonic
        plates.  One small drug store had slid below the surface, nearly out of eyesight.


        Truly, it was colorful, though.  The paint store had been tossing out old paints
        directly onto its neighbors.  The shops nearest the paint store were clogged with hundreds
        of colors, along the windowsills and in the rain gutters.  Yes, on the walls and pavement.


        Basically, beginning with the back porch of the paint store, the avenue erupted into a giant incongruous
        and poorly-dyed market.


        Further down, a dentist's office was primed with red paint and, over that, a fledgling artist
        had depicted a large baby who had fallen through a chimney and arrived in a fireplace full of soot.
        Crude black strokes marked the cloud of ashes raised during impact, easily mistaken for thick
        hair on the child's arms and back.  The child looked far too young to have much hair, but
        there they were: rich, blonde curls which toppled liberally from the child's head.  Under the child's
        legs was painted the word _BREWSTER_.


        The same artist had hit the library next store and had hastily slapped together a mural of
        a green sports car being pulled from the mud by a team of legless babies tugging with shiny chains.
        Again, the drastically blonde curls!


        "I need answers," said the Fox Tall, who had ground to a halt in front of the scenery.


        "I'm starting to believe there's no such thing," said Fox Small.  "Maybe these are the
        answers."


        "Brewster?" said Fox Tall.  He walked nearer to the library and touched the cheek of one
        of the legless children who was closer in perspective.  The child's cheek appeared to
        contain a myriad of jawbones.


        Blix was another two houses down, navigating through the askew brickwork, the paved gully that
        led to _R.K.'s Gorilla Mint_, as the metallic sticker on the door read.  The building was plastered
        with miniature logos for the variety of payment options and identification acceptable at
        _R.K.'s Gorilla Mint_.  Even the bars over the window were lined with insurance disclosures and
        security warnings and seals of government authorization, as well as addendums to all of these,
        carbon paper covering stickers covering torn posters and advertising.  And all mingled with
        paint splashes that intruded wherever they pleased.


        !i/wixl-9.gif(R.K.'s Gorilla Mint.)!


        "I like the way the fresh paper feels against my tongue," said the gorilla at the counter.
        His fingers rubbed quietly against the bills.  He drew his face near to the fanned currency
        and whisked his nose along the pulpy cash.


        "Is R.K. in this evening?" asked Blix.


        "R.K. is not," said the gorilla cashier.  He turned to the three travellers and spread
        his money out on the counter's surface, evenly spacing them apart and lining up all the
        edges neatly.  "Now, which one of these do you think is worth the most?"


        The foxes looked over the different bills and Fox Small muttered to himself, "Well,
        maybe-- no, but I'll bet-- Wait, does one of these have bananas on it?  'Cause that
        one-- nope, no fruit or rope swings or-- Terrible, this is difficult!"  And in a
        lower voice, "So difficult to read.  What does this one say?  Symbols or something?
        If all these bills have are symbols, it's going to be impossible for us to figure out
        which one is of the greatest value."


        "That's why I said, '_Guess_.'"  The gorilla tapped each bill in order.  "See, you've
        got a 1 in 5 chance."


        "Unless the symbols mean something," said Fox Tall.  "Unless we can figure it out."


        "We can figure it out," said Fox Small.


        "No," said the gorilla.  "The symbols are meaningless."


        "Whoever created the money intended some meaning for them," said Fox Small.  "Why
        use _this_ symbol?"  He pointed to an ampersand printed in dark ink.


        "Yeah, we saw you sniffing the money and fantasizing about it back there," said
        Fox Tall.  "I'll bet these symbols mean all kinds of things to you!"


        "No, I don't think so," said the gorilla.


        If I can weigh in at this point, I think the symbols do have meaning.  They may not
        be _loaded_ with meaning, it may not be oozing out through the cracks, but I'm sure
        there's a sliver of meaning.


        <pre>
         irb> $:
           => ["/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8", "/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/i686-linux", "/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby", 
               "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8", "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/i686-linux", "."]
        </pre> 


        Variables which start with the American cash sign are global variables.  They can
        be seen from anywhere in the program, *from inside any scope*.  (Dr. Cham used this
        variable while snooping around The Originals' computer bay.)


        So why does the *cash sign followed by a colon* represent an array of *all directories
        where Ruby will search when you try to load a file with @require@*?  The cash sign
        means "global."  But why the colon?


        Historically, on many operating systems, a list of directories contains colons which
        separated each entry.  I like to see the colon as a pair of eyes, scanning the directories
        for files.  We store our lookout list behind the eyes.


        Here's a few more special global variables:


        <pre>
         irb> $"      # The $" variable contains all files which have been loaded with `require'
           => ["irb.rb", "e2mmap.rb", "irb/init.rb", ... "rbconfig.rb"]
                      # These files are stored somewhere else, but their code is being used
                      # in this program.  Much like quoting someone else's work -- these are the
                      # footnotes -- hence the double-quote.

         irb> $0      # The $0 variable contains the running program's filename.
           => "irb"   # A zero can be considered the beginning of a number count.
                      # This variable answers the question, "Where did this program begin?"

         irb> $*      # The $* variable contains all the arguments passed into a program.
           => ['--prompt', 'simple']
                      # This one is easy to remember, if you remember that Ruby methods
                      # also use the asterisk to capture arguments into an array.

         # The $! contains the current exception raised.
         # The exclamation indicates a state of alarm.  An exception!
         irb> begin
         irb>   raise TypeError, "I don't believe this information."
         irb> rescue
         irb>   p $!
         irb> end
           => #<TypeError: I don't believe this information.>

         # The $@ contains the current backtrace, if an exception was raised.
         # The backtrace shows were Ruby was _at_ when the exception fired.
         irb> begin
         irb>   raise TypeError, "I don't believe this information."
         irb> rescue
         irb>   p $@
         irb> end
           => ["(irb):25:in `irb_binding'", "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/workspace.rb:52:in `irb_binding'", 
               "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/irb/workspace.rb:52"]
        </pre>


        "I don't remember you."  Blix looked at the gorilla with great interest.
        "Are you one of R.K.'s kids or something?"


        "Oh, come on!" said Fox Small, holding up a bill with an exclamation mark on it up to the gorilla's nose.
        "Don't tell me this means _nothing_ to you!  This one is probably _really important_
        since it has an exclamation on it.  Maybe it pays for emergency stuff!  Hospital
        bills or something!"


        *"Yeah, surgery!"* said Fox Tall.


        The gorilla looked at the foxes with disgust from under the brim of his cap.  "No,
        you're wrong.  You can't pay for surgeries with that."


        "But you see our point," said the small fox.  He grabbed some of the other bills.
        "And you say this bill _cannot_ pay for surgeries?  Well that sounds like it has
        a specific _non-surgery-related_ purpose.  Now, the question mark one.  Oh, what would that one be for?"

        
        "Hey, give me those," the gorilla snatched at the bills over the counter, but 
        his long thumb kept getting in the way and every time he thought he had grabbed bills, 
        it turned out he had only grabbed his long thumb.


        "Hey, hey, look, he's mad," said Fox Tall, happily clapping.  "I wonder why.  Did you notice
        how mad he started getting once we mentioned all these interesting meanings?  *We're on to
        you!  We figured out your game so fast!"*


        "We totally did!" said Fox Small, one of his elbows caught in the grip of the gorilla,
        the other arm waving a bill that featured an underscore.
        "This one's for buying floor supplies, maybe even big rolls of tile and linoleum."


        "See," said Fox Tall, working to pry the gorilla's fingers free, "we just have to figure out which is more expensive:
        surgery or linoleum!  This is _so easy!"_


        *"NO IT'S NOT!"* yelled the gorilla, yanking at the smaller fox and battering the
        fox with his palms.  *"YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MONKEY MONEY!!  YOU DON'T EVEN _HAVE_
        YOUR OWN KINDS OF MONEY!!"*


        "We could _easily_ have our own kinds of money!" said Fox Tall, taking the chimp's
        hat and tossing it to the back of the room, where it sailed behind a wall of safety
        deposit boxes.  "And -- _your hat is outta here!_"


        "Come on, give him back his bills," said Blix, waving his arms helplessly from the
        sidelines.  "We could really use this guy's help."


        "Stop hitting me!" screamed the littlest fox.  "I've almost figured out this one
        with the dots on it!!"


        Suddenly, with great precision and without warning, Fox Tall grabbed the monkey's nose
        and slammed his face down against the counter.  The pens and inkpads on its surface
        rattled and "Bam!" said the fox.  The gorilla's eyes spun sleepily
        as his arms... then his neck... then his head slithered to the floor behind the counter.


        Here are a few more global variables you might care to use:


        <pre>
         irb> $/      # The $/ is the line separator, it is normally set to \n, which represents _Enter_
           => "\n"    # or "end of line".  The slash represents a sword slashing lines in a file.

         # The line separator controls how methods like each_line or readlines breaks up strings.
         irb> "Jeff,Jerry,Jill\nMichael,Mary,Myrtle".each_line { |names| p names }
           => "Jeff,Jerry,Jill\n"
           => "Michael,Mary,Myrtle"

         # If you change the line separator, you change how many methods work, such as each_line.
         # See what happens when I change the line separator to a comma.
         irb> $/ = ','
         irb> "Jeff,Jerry,Jill\nMichael,Mary,Myrtle".each_line { |names| p names }
           => "Jeff,"
           => "Jerry,"
           => "Jill\nMichael,"
           => "Mary,"
           => "Myrtle"

         irb> $,     # The $, variable is the join separator, used when joining strings with
           => nil    # Array#join or Kernel::print.  The comma is a common join character.

         # The join separator is normally empty.
         irb> ['candle', 'soup', 'mackarel'].join
           => "candlesoupmackarel"
         irb> $, = ' * '; ['candle', 'soup', 'mackarel'].join
           => "candle * soup * mackarel"
         
         # But, usually, you won't need the global variable.
         irb> ['candle', 'soup', 'mackarel'].join ' # '
           => "candle # soup # mackarel"

         irb> $;     # The $; variable is the split separator, used when splitting strings
           => nil    # with String#split.

         # The split separator is normally empty, which means String#split will separate
         # the string where there is whitespace.
         irb> "candle  soup\nmackarel".split
           => ["candle", "soup", "mackarel"]
         irb> $; = 'a'; "candle  soup\nmackarel".split
           => ["c", "ndle  soup\nm", "ck", "rel"]

         # But, usually, you won't need the global variable.
         irb> "candle # soup # mackarel".split ' # '
           => ['candle', 'soup', 'mackarel']
        </pre>


        Outside the _Gorilla Mint_, Blix scolded the foxes.  "We could have used that guy's help!  If he knows
        where R.K. is, we could use his cunning!"


        "*We don't need that ape's money!*" said Fox Small.  "*We can make our _own_ money!*"


        "*We could support electronic wristbands!*" said Fox Tall.


        "His money is worthless," said Blix.  "It's gorilla money.  It has no value.  It's worse than
        blue crystals."


        "But it serves a purpose," said Fox Tall.


        "No it doesn't," said Fox Small.  "He just said it's worthless."


        "But what about linoleum and surgeries?" said Fox Tall.


        "Yeah," said Fox Small, up at Blix.  "What about linoleum and surgeries?"


        "If all the hospitals were staffed by gorillas and all the home improvement chains were strictly operated
        by gorillas, then -- YES -- you could buy linoleum and surgeries.  But I _guarantee_ that you would have
        very sloppy linoleum and very hideous surgeries.  I don't think you'd make it out of that economy alive."


        "So, if R.K. is so cunning," said Fox Tall, grinning slyly, "why does he print such worthless currency?"


        "It's a cover for other activities," said Blix.  "Besides, if you're so smart, why did you resort to
        violently pounding that poor gorilla?"


        "I guess that was a bad play," said Fox Tall, hanging his head.  "My friend here will tell you that I've
        been on edge all day."


        "And your rage finally reared its fuming snout!" said Fox Small.  "You're finally living up to your
        goatee."


        !i/wixl-10.gif!


        Down the lanes they travelled, the two foxes oblivious to their direction, but having a good time
        now that they had Blix leading the way with such urgency.  They lapsed into a careless wandering right behind Blix
        and spent their afternoon heckling most of the passersby.


        One such target of their ongoing commentary was The Winged Scroll Carriers, pairs of bats that carry
        documents which need to be immediately sworn and notarized.  There can be no delay, they must go swift,
        there is not even time to roll up the scroll, no, they must drop their swiss cheese and be out the door.


        These couriers resemble a kind of Ruby construct called *delimited types*.  A long series of characters
        comprises the scroll, flanked on each side by a bat bracing its curly wings to hold the scroll together.
        The opening bat wears a hat on which is written @%w@, which identifies the scroll as a set of words.


        <pre>
         irb> bats = %w{The Winged Scroll Carriers}
           => ['The', 'Winged', 'Scroll', 'Carriers']
        </pre>


        The @%w@ bats and their scroll, when fed into Ruby, emerge as an array of words.  This syntax is a shortcut
        in case you don't want to go through the trouble of decorating each word with commas and quotes.  You are
        in a hurry, too, there can be no delay.  You jot out the words between the bats and let Ruby figure out where
        to cut.


        Other bats, other hats.  For instance, the @%x@ hat runs an external program.


        <pre>
         irb> %w{ruby --help}
           => ["ruby", "--help"]
         irb> %x{ruby --help}
           => "Usage: ruby [switches] [--] [programfile] [arguments] ..."
        </pre>


        My favorite is the @%Q@ hat, which can also be written as just @%@.  This acts just like a double-quoted string,
        but looks nice when used with strings that run-on for many lines.  Like, say you're adding a new method with @eval@.


        <pre>
         m = "bats!"
         eval %{
           def #{ m }
             puts "{" * 100
           end
         }
        </pre>


        Just like a double-quoted string, you can use the string interpolation lilypads inside.


        !i/wixl-15.png(Cloneberries: The More You Eat, The More *You*.)!


        Blixy wagged his head.  "Oh, dear me."


        "Egads! My hand is pregnant," said Fox Tall, watching the little fox embryo slide about in his palm.


        "They are good berries, though," said Blix.  "The wine they make from these berries
        will make ya grow a few eyeballs in your teeth.  But no more than that."


        "Ah, pain!" yelled Fox Small, as his miniature squeezed out through the pores in his scalp.  But soon he
        was cradling his little self and murmuring lullablies.  _Nevermore, nevermore, sweetly sang the
        nightingale.  Winking starlight, sleeping still, whilst perched on a Sycamore stump._


        Making duplicates of Ruby objects is no more than a berry's worth of code.


        <pre>
         irb> tree = [:berry, :berry, :berry]
           => [:berry, :berry, :berry]
         irb> treechild = tree.clone
           => [:berry, :berry, :berry]
        </pre>


        The @clone@ method makes an exact copy of a Ruby object.  How does this differ from regular
        assignment?


        <pre>
         irb> tree_charles_william_iii = tree
           => [:berry, :berry, :berry]
        </pre>


        Assigning object to variables only creates more nicknames.  The above Array can be called @tree_charles_william_iii@
        now.  Or the shorter @tree@.  The same object, but different names.


        However, a clone is a copy of an object.  You can modify it without affecting the original.


        <pre>
         irb> treechild << 'flower'
           => [:berry, :berry, :berry, 'flower']
         irb> tree
           => [:berry, :berry, :berry]
        </pre>


        The @clone@ method doesn't make copies of everything attached to the object, though.  In the array above, only the
        array is copied, not all the symbols and strings inside.


        You may also see the @dup@ method used to copy objects.  The @dup@ method makes copies which aren't as exact.  For example,
        there are objects in Ruby which are "frozen" and can't be altered.  If you @clone@ the object, you get an exact copy which
        is also frozen.  If you use @dup@, you get an unfrozen copy that you can change if you like.


        The @clone@ method also copies the metaclass of an object, whereas @dup@ does not.


        <pre>
         irb> o = Object.new
         irb> class << o
         irb>   def nevermore; :nevermore; end
         irb> end

         irb> o.clone.nevermore
           => :nevermore
         irb> o.dup.nevermore
         # NoMethodError: undefined method `nevermore' for #<Object:0xb7d4a484>
         #         from (irb):7
         </pre>


        You don't always need to make copies of objects, though, since many methods like @collect@ and @gsub@
        and @format@ make copies for you as part of their work.


        !i/wixl-4.gif(Deer of the Smoky Pink Puffing.)!


        Over the hills and down the valleys, they ran through the grass where the Deer of the Smoky Pink
        Puffing roam.  The sun was obscured by the lumbering pink clouds, emblazened with deer language,
        tinting the horizon a gradient of grapefruit and secreting a glow over the meadow.  The clouds
        slid past each other, some bobbing upwards, destined for Canadian relatives.  Others landing a
        readable distance from a recipient's hooves.


        "Let's stop!  _Please!_" yelled Fox Tall.  "You can't expect us to run in this *unbreathable fluff!*"


        "Why are you yelling?" said Blix, as a thin stratus telegram wafted behind his legs.  "You don't
        need to raise your voice above a whisper.  These long skinny clouds are usually just a mumble or
        a sigh.  They may not even make it all the way."

      Steaks 'n' Slides: >

        My uncles love waterslides and they also love steakhouses.  They have these waterslide days
        which are directly followed by a trip over to Joey's Steakhouse.  I _hate_ Joey's Steakhouse.  It's
        all big, brown shoe meat.  Floppy and galoshy.  Mixed with the stench of the uncles' chlorine.


        Pruny fingers on meat slabs is The Revolting.


        It's time for steaks and waterslides to come together in a truly repugnant manner.
        My uncles have had steaks and waterslides their whole lives.  The dynasty of steaks
        and waterslides must come to a close.  I will marry them in ways against nature!


        Like this:


        * Hand steaks to riders as they board the waterslide.  Rider looks at the lifeguard.
        Lifeguard says wait.  Rider looks again.  The lifeguard pauses.  Then.  Okay, it's time.
        _Go, kid, go!_  And the look on that kid's face as he rushes down the slope, paws
        full of chuck!  _Go, kid, go!_

        * Kids slide on top of steaks.  For safety, we'd want the slides stacked five steaks deep.

        * Or, steaks do the sliding.  In their own little swim trunks.

        * Or, people.  With steak swim trunks.

        * People and steaks, side-by-side.
        
        * Steaks travelling down waterslides composed of steaks.

        * Steaks travelling down waterslides made of people.

        * And, of course, people eating steaks, but their tongues come out as waterslides and
        they have to push the steaks up the waterslides.  Which is impossible and a lifeguard has to climb
        up the waterslide and manually insert the steak into the esophagus.

        * Waterslides eating people and steaks eating people.

        * Waterslides and steaks becoming friends after smelling people on each other's breath.

        * Or, steaks befriending waterslides, but waterslides not reciprocating.  Waterslides
        become increasingly despondent and detached, getting into bad crowds and sinking into
        political extremity.  Steaks make ankle bracelets out of people and leave them in the
        waterslides' trouser pockets, when the trousers are unattended.  They sneak out of the
        waterslide commune via a huge waterslide made of steak swim trunks.

        * Or, like I said, people with steak swim trunks.

        "All that writing on the cloud is deer talk?" said Fox Small.


        "Help!  _Where are you guys?_"  The taller fox ducked through a stormy tirade comprised of
        thick, billowing smoke and sharp wisps.  He whirled in every direction, "Somebody yell if you're
        there!"
        
        
        He searched for a fissure in the dense matter, combing forward with his hands.  The verbose, angry
        clouds responded by prodding him ahead, forcing him into tight corners in their brief pause
        between sentences.  He landed in a sinkhole and kept his head down as the cascades of smoke
        surged forward.


        "Yeah, deer can read this stuff," said Blix.  "They just face their target and shoot it out of
        their nostrils.  I once heard of a guy who *rode* a stag's love poem."


        "No way," said Fox Small.


        "Yep," said Blix.  "And that guy was me."  Blix reached over his shoulder and latched onto
        a spiral column of smoke that was twisting just above his head.  "You just have to know
        which clouds are wimpy and which clouds are grandiloquent."  Blix let the cloud pull him along
        and when the cloud banked upwards, Blix loosed his grip and kept his feet moving slowly
        along the ground.  "See, here's a good one, long like a broom handle.  A guy found one once
        and it was shaped _exactly_ like a car: windshield, driver's side airbag, power steering.
        Uncanny!"


        "_And that guy was--_"


        *"It was!"*  And Blix climbed up atop the long icy cloud, with its dangling glyphs, and stood proudly,
        floating high above the small fox's pointy shadow.


        "Oh, I could do that," said Fox Small.  "Tall and I go jetskiing all the time.  _I've stood
        up on my jetski._  It's just like that."


        Fox Tall dashed through a descending puff, shattering its sentence, which letters
        came unglued and littered the ground with scrambled words, but he had only succeeded in
        reaching the depressive portions of the deer correspondence, which manifested itself
        as a dank and opaque mist.


        Meanwhile, his smaller counterpart grabbed a narrow train of smoke that passed under his
        arm.  He was airborned and yelled, *"Tallyho!"*  But he held too tightly and the cloud
        evaporated under his arm and sent him back down with a short hop.


        Since you're just beginning your use of Ruby, you may not fully grasp regular expressions
        (or _regexps_) at first.  You may even find yourself clipping out regexps from the "Regular
        Expression Library":http://regexlib.com/DisplayPatterns.aspx and pasting them into your
        code without having the foggiest idea why the expression works.  Or _if_ it works!


        <pre>
         loop do
           print "Enter your password: "
           password = gets
           if password.match( /^\w{8,15}$/ )
             break
           else
             puts "** Bad password! Must be 8 to 15 characters!"
           end
         end
        </pre>
         

        Do you see the unreadable deer language in the example code?  The @/^\w{8,15)$/@ is a regular
        expression.  If I may translate, the regexp is saying, _Please only allow letters, numbers or
        underscores.  No less than eight and no more than fifteen._


        Regular expressions are a mini-language built into Ruby and many other programming languages.
        I really shouldn't say _mini_, though, since regexps can be twisted and complicated and much more
        difficult than any Ruby program.


        Using regular expressions is extremely simple.  It is like the Deer: making the smoke is an
        arduous process.  But hooking your elbow around the smoke and driving it to the Weinerschnitzel
        to get mustard pretzel dogs is easy.


        <pre>
         irb> "good_password".match( /^\w{8,15}$/ )
           => #<MatchData:0xb7d54218>
         irb> "this_bad_password_too_long".match( /^\w{8,15}$/ )
           => nil
        </pre>


        The @String#match@ method is the _simplest practical use_ of regexps.  The @match@ method
        checks to see if the string meets the rules inside the regexp.  A regexp is only useful with
        strings, to test strings for a series of conditions.  If the conditions are met, a @MatchData@
        object is returned.  If not, you get @nil@.


        The most basic regular expressions are for *performing searches* inside strings.  Let's say
        you've got a big file and you want to search it for a word or phrase.  Since a bit of time
        has passed, let's search the Preeventualist's Losing and Finding Registry again.


        <pre>
         require 'preeventualist'
         PreEventualist.searchfound( 'truck' ) do |page|
           page.each_line do |line|
             puts line if line.match( /truck/ )
           end
         end
        </pre>


        This isn't too different from the code we used earlier to search for lines with the word "truck".  Earlier
        we used @puts line if line['truck']@, which is actually a simpler way of searching a string, if you're
        just looking for a simple word.  The regexp @/truck/@ is identical.  Find the word "truck".  Anywhere in the string.


        Uhm, what if truck is capitalized.  *Truck.*  What then?


        <pre>
         puts line if line.match( /[Tt][Rr][Uu][Cc][Kk]/i )
        </pre>


        The *character classes* are the sections surrounded by *square brackets*.  Each character class gives
        a list of characters which are valid matches for that spot.  (The first spot matches either an uppercase @T@
        or a lowercase @t@.  The second spot matches an @R@ or an @r@.  And so on.)


        But a simpler way to write it is like this:


        <pre>
         puts line if line.match( /truck/i )
        </pre>


        The letter @i@ modifier at the end of the regexp indicates that the search is *not case-sensitive*.  It
        will match Truck.  And TRUCK.  And TrUcK.  And other ups and downs.


        Oh, and maybe you're truck is a certain model number.  A T-1000.  Or a T-2000.  You can't remember.  It's
        a T _something_ thousand.


        <pre>
         puts line if line.match( /T-\d000/ )
        </pre>


        See, deer language.  The @\d@ represents a *digit*.  It's a place holder in the regexp for any type of
        number.  The regexp will now match T-1000, T-2000, all the way up to T-9000.


        |\3. *Character Classes* |

        | @\d@ | matches digits | can also be written @[0-9]@ |

        | @\w@ | matches word characters (letters, numbers and the underscore) | can also be written @[A-Za-z0-9_]@ |

        | @\s@ | matches whitespace (spaces, tabs, carriage returns, line feeds) | a.k.a. @[ \t\r\n]@ |

        | @\D@ | matches everything _but_ digits | a negated set @[^\d]@ |
        
        | @\W@ | matches everything _but_ word chars | just like @[^\w]@ |
        
        | @\S@ | matches everything _but_ whitespace | also @[^\s]@ |

        | @.@ | the period matches *everything*. |


        Building a regexp involves chaining these placeholders together to express your search.  If you're looking for
        a number, followed by whitespace: @/\d\s/@.  If you're looking for three numbers in a row: @/\d\d\d/@.  *The opening
        and closing slashes mark the beginning and end of the regexp.*


        A search for three numbers in a row can also be written as: @/\d{3}/@.  Immediately following a character class
        like @\d@, you can use a quantifier symbol to mark how many times you want the character class to be repeat.


        |\3. *Quantifiers* |

        | @{n}@ | match exactly _n_ times | Precisely three numbers in a row is @/\d{3}/@ |

        | @{n,}@ | matches _n_ times or _more_ | Three or more letters in a row is @/[a-z]{3,}/i@ |

        | @{n,n2}@ | matches at least _n_ times but no more than _n2_ times | So, @/[\d,]{3,9}/@ matches
        between three and nine characters which are numbers or commas |

        | @*@ | the asterisk @*@ is short for @{0,}@ | To match a colon, followed by zero or more word characters: @/:\w*/@ |

        | @+@ | the plus is short for @{1,}@ | To match one or more minus or plus signs, use @/[-+]+/@ |

        | @?@ | the question mark is short for @{0,1}@ | To match three numbers followed by an optional period: @/\d{3}[.]?/@ |


        A really common regular expression is for matching phone numbers.  American phone numbers (including an area
        code) can be matched using the digit character class and the precise quantifiers.


        <pre>
         irb> "Call 909-375-4434" =~ /\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/
           => 5
         irb> "The number is (909) 375-4434" =~ /[(]\d{3}[)]\s*\d{3}-\d{4}/
           => 14
        </pre>


        This time, instead of using @match@ to search for the expression, the @=~@ operator was used.  This operator is the
        *match operator*, an equals sign followed by *a tilde*.  The tilde is like a bit of smoke coming off the edge of a
        smokestack.  Remember the deer, the smoke they blow, a cryptic language just like regular expressions.  The smoky
        tilde points toward the regexp.


        The match operator returns a number.  The number is the spot in the string where the regular expression matched.
        So when the match operator returns @5@, it's saying, "Before the match, there are five characters in the string."


        If you need to get the full string matched, you can use the special @$&@ global variable if you're using the
        match operator.  Or, if you're using the @match@ method, you can get the full string by converting the @MatchData@ object
        to a string.


        <pre>
         # Using =~ and $& together.
         irb> "The number is (909) 375-4434" =~ /[(]\d{3}[)]\s*\d{3}-\d{4}/
           => 14
         irb> $&
           => "(909) 375-4434"

         # Using the MatchData object.
         irb> phone = /[(]\d{3}[)]\s*\d{3}-\d{4}/.match("The number is (909) 375-4434")     
           => #<MatchData:0xb7d51680>
         irb> phone.to_s
           => "(909) 375-4434"
        </pre>


        Most Rubyists prefer the second approach, as it uses an object within a _local variable_ rather than a _global variable_.
        Global variables are kind of sketchy, since they can be easily overwritten.  If you run two regular expressions in a
        row, the global variable gets overwritten the second time.  But with local variables, you can keep both matches around
        as long as the variables are named differently.


        Other than matching, another common use of regular expression is to do *search-and-replace* from within Ruby.
        You can search for the word "cat" and replace it with the word "banjo."  Sure, you can do that with strings or regexps.


        <pre>
         irb> song = "I swiped your cat / And I stole your cathodes"
         irb> song.gsub 'cat', 'banjo'
           => "I swiped your banjo / And I stole your banjohodes"

         irb> song.gsub /\bcat\b/, 'banjo'
           => "I swiped your banjo / And I stole your cathodes"
        </pre>


        The @gsub@ method is named for "global substitution."  Notice how in the first example it replaced the word "cat" and the first
        three letters of "cathodes."  Strings also have a simple @sub@ method which will substite only once.


        And so this chapter ends, with Blix and the Foxes cruising aloft the solid pink belched from a very outspoken
        deer somewhere in those pastures.


#        Using regular expressions for substitution is incredibly sly.  
#
#
#        |\3. *Positional Marks* |
#
#        | @^@ | matches the beginning of a line | Test a string for a starting pound sign: @/^#/@ |
#
#        | @$@ | matches the end of a line | Look for empty lines: @/^\s*$/@ |
#
#        | @\b@ | matches the edge of a word, beginning or end | Find words which start with a vowel: @/\b[aeiou]/@ |
#
#        | @\A@ | matches the beginning of the string | Check if a string opens with a greeting: @/AHello/@ |
#
#        | @\z@ | matches the end of the string | Ensure a string contains only word characters: @/\A\w\z/@ |

#           File.read( filename ).scan( /(.+): (.+)/ ) do |k, v|
#             hsh[k] = v
#           end
#         end
#        </pre>
#
#
#        If I can offer one piece of advice with regard to regular expressions, it's this: be yourself.  Don't get so
#        wrapped up in regular expressions that you forget who you are.

        !>i/quil-1.png!


        !<i/quil-2.png!


        One day, back around the time I met Bigelow (that dog who walked off with the balloons), I came back to my apartment
        hauling some board games I'd bought at a garage sale.  And Quil was on my porch.  Which stunned me since she'd been in
        San Antonio for like three years.  She was sleeping in a sleeping bag on my porch.


        She had run out of money to go to art school, so she stayed at my place for five months or so.


        I found this used bunkbed for our place.  At night we'd sit in our beds and read each other stories 
        from our notebooks.  I was writing a book about
        a kid who's a detective and he's trying to figure out who killed this kid on his tennis team and all these animals
        end up helping him figure it out.  She was writing a book about this kid who puts an ad in the classifieds to get
        other kids to join his made-up cult and they end up building a rocket ship.  But during most of her book these
        kids are lost in the woods and pretty directionless, which I got a kick out of hearing each night.


        Yeah, each night it was poetry or stories or ideas for tricking our neighbors.  Our neighbor Justin was
        a big fan of Warhammer and he had all these real swords and tunics.  We decided to make suits of armor out of tin
        foil and go attack his apartment.  We started ransacking his apartment and he loved it.  So he made his own suit
        of armor out of tin foil and we all went to a professional glamour studio and had a quality group shot taken.


        !>i/quil-3.png!


        I'm not saying my life is any better than yours.  I just miss my sister.  Life isn't like that now.
        We're dissolved or something.


        I don't know.  I'm confused.  Is this growing up?  Watching all your feathers come off?  And even though some of those
        feathers were the most lovely things?


        I'm having a hard time telling who stopped it all up.  Who stopped loving who?  Did I stop caring?  Maybe I only
        saw her in two-dimensions and I didn't care to look at the other angles.  I only saw planes.  Then she shimmied up the z-axis when I wasn't
        looking and I never did the homework to trace the coordinates.  A limb on a geometrical tree and I am insisting on circles.


        Blix was right.  I'm in so shape to write this book.  Goodbye until I can shake this.

      About Ruby Versions: >

        If you've visited any sites which offer Ruby for download, you've probably seen a number
        of different versions of Ruby available.  Obviously, the greater the version number, the
        more recent the version of Ruby.  But that's not exactly true.  Version numbers have meaning
        in Rubyland and I'd like you to make an educated choice.


        *1.8.2* is the latest *stable* version of Ruby.  Stable versions offer the latest features
        which have been widely tested and are recommended for general use.  When new stable versions
        come out, you can safely upgrade to these new versions.


        *1.9.0* is the latest *development* release of Ruby.  The development release includes
        experimental changes to Ruby and unfixed problems.  This release is for anyone who wants
        take a peep into the future of Ruby at the risk of encountering some bugs.


        Now, you'll notice that the version number is comprised of three individual numbers,
        which are: *the major version*, *the minor version*, and *the teeny version*.  The 
        major version counts each complete rewrite of Ruby.  The minor version is changed based
        on sweeping changes to Ruby.  The teeny version is incremented every few months as smaller
        changes and bug fixes are brought in.


        All editions of Ruby thus far have a major version of 1.  When Ruby2 comes along, you'll
        see this notch up one.


        The minor version indicates whether a version is stable or not.  *If the minor version
        is an even number, then that version of Ruby is stable.   If it's odd, then that Ruby
        is a development version.*  After a year or so, when the development version is ready 
        for the world, both numbers are increased and the teeny version is returned to zero.


        Oh, and if I could give you a taste of how smoothly Ruby moves along!  I can't count
        how often a fresh idea lands on the Ruby-Core mailing list, where the Emperors of
        Ruby converse, and *that same idea* gets worked into Ruby within a few days.  It is
        a lovely machine says I.

    - >
      Let's install the very latest Ruby on your computer so you can follow all the examples
      in the (Poignant) Guide and actually do things right now!  (Yes, things!)


      * If you are using *Microsoft Windows*, begin by downloading the "Ruby Installer for
      Windows":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167.  Running this "one-click" installer will
      setup Ruby for you, as well as a tidy pack of useful software, such as a small text editor and some
      additional libraries.

      * If you are on Apple's *Mac OS X*, then Ruby might already be installed.  Versions 10.2 and
      10.3 of OS X both came with Ruby.  Still, I encourage you to upgrade Ruby so that all the examples
      in this book will work for you.  Download a *stable* "disk image":http://homepage.mac.com/discord/Ruby/.
      You will need OS X 10.3 (Panther) and the XCode Tools in order to use this image.

      * On *FreeBSD*, Ruby is right there in the ports system.  In fact, if you've used the essential
      @portupgrade@ tool, then Ruby is already installed.  Akinori Musha, one of Ruby's immensely
      talented core developers, wrote portupgrade, which means that you can use your Ruby learning
      right away to hack up your @pkgtools.conf@.

      <pre class="text">
       cd /usr/ports/lang/ruby18
       sudo make install
      </pre>

      * On *RedHat* or *Mandrake* Linux, you can find "Ruby RPMs":http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=Ruby.
      I believe Ruby is also available through Ximian's Red Carpet.

      * On *Debian*, use @apt-get install ruby@.

      * On *Gentoo*, @emerge ruby@.

      * Other *Linux* and *UNIX* platforms, even *OS X* (if the disk images don't work for you): 
      Download the "latest source code":http://ruby-lang.org/en/20020102.html.  
      For instance, "Ruby 1.8.2":ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz.  To unpack and compile:

      <pre class="text">
       tar xzvf ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz
       cd ruby-1.8.2
       ./configure
       make
       make install
      </pre>

      (Again, the above commands are for installing Ruby from the source code.  You may need to use
      @su@ or @sudo@ to give you permission to run the @make install@.)


      To test if Ruby is installed, open a command shell and run: @ruby -v@.  If Ruby is installed
      properly, you'll see a bit of version info.


      <pre class="text">
       ruby 1.8.2 (2004-12-25) [i386-mswin32]
      </pre>


      * To open a command shell in *Microsoft Windows*, go to the Start Menu and select @Run...@.
      Type in: @cmd@.  Press OK.  A command shell window will appear.

      * To open a command shell on *Mac OS X*, go to *Applications > Utilities*.  Run the *Terminal*
      program.

 
      Okay, keep that command shell open cause we'll need it if the Earth gets rescued from its
      plummet toward the sun.


      !i/tigers.vest-2.gif(Tiger saves Earth with Ice Gun.  Girl robot zooms around tuxed shop...)!


      Ruby comes with a very, very, very extremely helpful tool called *Irb*.  Interactive Ruby.
      In your command shell, type: @irb@.


      <pre>
       irb(main):001:0>
      </pre>


      You should see the prompt above.  This Irb prompt will allow you to enter Ruby code and,
      upon pressing _Enter_, the code will run.


      So, at the Irb prompt, do a: @3000 + 500@.


      <pre>
       irb(main):001:0> 3000 + 500
       => 3500
       irb(main):002:0>      
      </pre>
      

      The example @3000 + 500@ is legitimate code.  We're just not assigning the answer to a variable.
      Which is okay in Irb, because Irb prints the answer given back by code you run.


      Irb is a great calculator.


      <pre>
       irb(main):002:0> ( ( 220.00 + 34.15 ) * 1.08 ) / 12
       => 22.8735
       irb(main):003:0> "1011010".to_i( 2 )
       => 90
       irb(main):004:0> Time.now - Time.local( 2003, "Jul", 31, 8, 10, 0 )
       => 31119052.510118
      </pre>


      The first example demonstrates a bit of math and is read as: _220.00 plus 34.15 times 1.08 divided by 12_.
      The second example takes a binary string and converts it to a decimal number.  The third example computes
      the number of seconds between @now@ and July 31, 2003 at 8:10 AM.  The answers to all of these are
      printed back to us by Irb with a little ASCII arrow pointing.


      h3. Reading the Prompt


      I know the prompt surely looks bewildering.  Well, let's not delay in dissecting it.  It's very simple.
      The prompt has three parts, each separated by *colons*.


      The first section, which reads @irb(main)@, shows *the name of the program* we are running.  The second
      section shows a line number, *a count of how many lines of Ruby we've typed*.  The third section is *a
      depth level*.  Whenever you open a statement which needs closing, the depth level will increase by one.
      And whenever Irb senses that your code is unfinished, *the end of the prompt will become an asterisk.*  


      <pre>
       irb(main):001:0> bell = :pressed
       => :pressed
       irb(main):002:0> ice_gun =
       irb(main):003:0*   if bell == :pressed
       irb(main):004:1>     :on
       irb(main):005:1>   else
       irb(main):006:1*     :off
       irb(main):007:1>   end
       => :on
      </pre>
        

      Notice how the depth level increased to 1 when I opened the @if@ statement.  And how the asterisk
      indicates the continuation of a line.


      h3. Tweaking the Prompt


      You don't have to like the prompt's appearance, though.  I'm not forcing you to do anything and,
      if you want to hack it up, I'm right here beside you.


      Irb has a few other included prompts which may better appease your senses.  Try @irb --prompt simple@.
      This time Irb will treat you to a very basic set of arrows, allowing you to enter your code without
      the whole status report.


      <pre>
       >> %w(my best friend's arm)
       => ["my", "best", "friend's", "arm"]
       >> 
      </pre>


      Ruby comes with a few prompts.  The *simple* prompt seen above.  The *xmp* prompt which has no
      prompt at all and indents the answer arrow.  (It's supposed to look nice for printing.)  Also,
      the *null* prompt, which eliminates prompts altogether.  Set the prompt by just supplying the
      name with the @--prompt@ option.  (So, @irb --prompt null@.)


      Making your own prompt is okay as well.  Irb is completely customizable from inside of itself.
      The @conf@ object contaions all of Irb's configuration settings.  Some of these configuration
      settings are for controlling the prompt.


      <pre>
       >> conf.methods.grep /prompt/
       => ["prompting?", "prompt_s", "prompt_s=", "prompt_c", "prompt_c=", 
           "prompt_i", "prompt_mode", "prompt_i=", "prompt_mode="]
      </pre>


      Let's setup our prompt to display line numbers with just a bit of decor.


      <pre>
       >> conf.prompt_i = "%3n :> "           # the normal prompt
       >> conf.prompt_s = "%3n .%l "          # the string continuation prompt
       >> conf.prompt_c = "%3n .^ "           # the code continuation prompt
       >> conf.return_format = "    => %s\n"  # the answer arrow
      </pre>


      Above are the four parts to an Irb prompt.  The string continuation prompt is displayed when
      a string is still open when you hit _Enter_.  The @%3n@ describes that Irb should reserve three
      characters for the line number.  The @%l@ saves a place for displaying the type of string being
      continued.  (If you're continuing a double-quoted string, it shows a double quote.  If you're
      continuing a regular expression, it shows a slash.)


      The rest are little symbols to decorate the prompt.  So, in the case of a continuing code line,
      I show a caret which points up to the line where that line of code started. 


      You can read more about customizing Irb and saving your configuration to a file in 
      the complete "guide to Irb":http://www.rubycentral.com/book/irb.html, available in
      the free-for-your-wandering-Internet-eyes _Programming Ruby_.

      Windows Hiccups: >      

        Okay, here's what you do to get tab completion working in Windows.  
        "Download this.":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/dist/readline.so-for-1.8.zip
        A zip with two files inside.  These get copied into your Ruby installation.
        Place readline.dll in the *bin* folder.  The readline.so goes in
        *lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32* folder.


        Then, run in your command shell: @irb --readline -r irb/completion@.


        And for Europeans, you'll need "this.":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/dist/Input.euro
        Save it as *.inputrc* and place it in your home directory.  (Your personal directory
        which contains your Desktop and My Documents folders.)

      h3. Tab Completion


      One feature of Irb which is rarely mentioned is its beneficial tab completion.  And it's
      a bit of a taboo topic at the moment, since getting it to work on Windows is a slight horror.
      (No, don't be afraid.  All at once now, look to your right.)


      If you're on Linux or FreeBSD, the tab completion should work right off.  And if you're
      using OS X, you should be sure you're upgrade to the latest 1.8 and when run Irb, use:


      <pre class="text">
       irb --readline -r irb/completion
      </pre> 


      Basically, when you hit _Tab_, Irb will take a guess at what you're trying to type.
      Try typing: @[].col@ and hit _Tab_.  Irb will finish it.  @[].collect@ and it leaves your
      cursor at the end so you can add further.


      If there are several matches, just hitting _Tab_ will do nothing.  But hit it twice
      and Ruby will give you a complete list of possible matches.


      This is great if you just want to see all the methods for a certain object.  Type in any
      number, a dot, and use _Tab_.


      <pre class="text">

      Without delay, right up on your teletype display (so swiftly that even the cat perched
      atop cranes his neck around, gapes and hands it the royal cup _Most Blatantly Great
      Thing Since Michael Dorn_):


      <pre class="text">

       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Converts any arguments to arrays, then merges elements of _enum_
            with corresponding elements from each argument. This generates a

      out there fighting the pull of some zero-tolerance tractor beam, just use at your
      command shell: @ri Class@.


      But for help on class methods, you cuff on: @ri Class::method@.


      Though instance methods use a pound key rather than a dot.  (Since the dot can mean class *or*
      instance methods.)  I mean: @ri Class#method@.


      The full spread of classes, a full list from the Very Top down to the Earth's core, can be
      achieved with @ri -c@.

      h3. Into the Ri Switchboard


      Behind Ri sings a chorus of human voices, primarily Dave Thomas, an author of _Programming
      Ruby_, and absolutely the American foster parent of Ruby.  Many of these elaborate
      spiels from Ri are straight from the references of _Programming Ruby_.  Don't forget
      to thank Dave periodically.


      Ri culls its lush information set from the very code that Ruby is built from.  In each
      of the files of code back in the Ruby Headquarter's file cabinet, detailed comments
      describe everything in sight.


      In Ruby's @date@ class, here we have such commented methods:


      <pre>
       # Get the time of this date as [hours, minutes, seconds,
       # fraction_of_a_second]
       def time() self.class.day_fraction_to_time(day_fraction) end
       
       # Get the hour of this date.
       def hour() time[0] end
         
       # Get the minute of this date.
       def min() time[1] end
      </pre>


      The comments show up in Ri.  We type: @ri Date#time@.


      <pre class="text">
       -------------------------------------------------------------- Date#time
            time()
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Get the time of this date as [hours, minutes, seconds,
            fraction_of_a_second]

      </pre>


      Ri figures out much of how a method works, although it expects coders to
      write a brief description in the comments just before a method or class definition.
      I would suggest that whenever you write a method, add a brief
      description in the comments before that method.  In time, you can generate
      Ri documentation for that method.


      You can also use a few special characters to enhance your description.  For
      example, if you indent a paragraph and use an asterisk @*@ or a dash @-@
      just before the letters of the first sentence, the paragraph will be recognized
      as a list item.  Then, if your description needs to be converted to HTML, you'll
      see the list item appear as an HTML unordered list.


      <pre>
       # Get the time of this date as an Array of:
       # * hours
       # * minutes
       # * seconds
       # * fraction_of_a_second
       def time() self.class.day_fraction_to_time(day_fraction) end
      </pre>


      Other rules as well:  Lists which start with digits followed by periods are
      recognized as numbered lists.  Emphasized words are surrounded by underscores,
      bold words by asterisks, code words by plus signs.  Examples are simply blocks
      of text indented a few spaces.  All of these rules together are called RDoc.


      Here's a bit of RDoc from the @initialize@ method in one of my projects
      called RedCloth.  Notice the indented example as well as the Ruby class
      and method names flanked with plusses.


      <pre>
       #
       # Returns a new RedCloth object, based on +String+ and
       # enforcing all the included +restrictions+.
       #
       #   r = RedCloth.new( "h1. A <b>bold</b> man", [:filter_html] )
       #   r.to_html
       #     #=>"<h1>A &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; man</h1>"
       #
       def initialize( string, restrictions = [] )
           @lite = false
           restrictions.each { |r| method( "#{ r }=" ).call( true ) }
           super( string )
       end
      </pre>


      For the full set of RDoc rules see the *Markup* section of the 
      "README":http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/files/README.html.


      h3. Pushing Out Your Own Ri


      Ri doesn't automatically read your files for you, though.  You've got to push it along,
      show it the way.  Change to the directory of the code you'd like to scan.  Then, use
      the RDoc tool to make it happen.


      <pre class="text">
       cd ~/cvs/your-code
       rdoc --ri-site
      </pre>


      Now, try using @ri YourClass@ to ensure all your descriptions are showing up properly.
      If you want to make HTML documentation, try this:


      <pre class="text">
       cd ~/cvs/your-code
       rdoc
      </pre>


      The @~/cvs/your-code@ directory should now also have a fresh @doc@ directory containing
      HTML documentation for all of your classes.  View @index.html@ for the pleasant news.


      Well then.  Your hands are in it all now.  Welcome to Ruby.
